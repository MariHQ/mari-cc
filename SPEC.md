# Mari — Product Specification (the "What")

This is the master behavioral specification for Mari, a local-first Claude Code plugin. Mari lets teams curate, search, and share their product knowledge layer, and enforces prose quality on everything Claude writes. This document defines every command, subcommand, switch, configuration key, rule, and behavior — independent of implementation language, library, or cloud choices. A companion document (the "how") will map this spec onto concrete technology.

---

## 1. Product overview

Mari answers "What should our AI know, trust, and reuse?" It has five pillars:

1. **Ingest & search** — make the knowledge teams already use retrievable by Claude with local hybrid search via a rich context graph. Sources: Slack, GitHub, Granola, Google Drive, Jira, Confluence, Zendesk, Salesforce, HubSpot, Microsoft 365, Discord, git history, and local files.
2. **Curate** — tag knowledge as canonical, stale, deprecated, draft, internal, customer-facing, or needs-review; maintain a glossary and a facts ledger; audit the knowledge base.
3. **Improve AI-authored content** — an editorial vocabulary (`deslop`, `tighten`, `understate`, `clarify`, `critique`, `polish`, …) plus a deterministic ~170-rule detector for AI slop, clarity, house style, and inclusive language.
4. **Ground claims** — factcheck content against FACTS.md, source-of-truth files, and the knowledge base; catch contradictions and unsupported claims before publish.
5. **Keep it alive** — deterministic post-edit hooks, edit-notify rules, doc↔code lineage, localization staleness checks, and docsite generation/validation.

### 1.1 Design invariants

These are non-negotiable behaviors, carried over from the prototypes:

- **Local-first.** All indexing, embedding, and search run on the user's machine. No hard SaaS dependency, no external LLM calls from the CLI. Team sharing goes through infrastructure the team already controls (Git LFS, S3, Mari SaaS).
- **Configuration is files, never environment variables.** No config env vars are read. (A small set of *capability toggles* for optional ML features are permitted; see §17.4.)
- **Credentials never enter the repo.** They live under the user's home Mari directory with restrictive permissions (dir `0700`, files `0600`).
- **Hooks never break the turn.** A hook always exits 0 and emits nothing on internal failure.

---

## 3. Workspaces, files, and scopes

### 3.1 Directory layout

| Location | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `~/.mari/config.json` | Global (per-user) config. `mari config set` writes here. |
| `~/.mari/credentials/<provider>.json` | Credentials for globally-scoped connectors. Mode `0600`. |
| `~/.mari/scopes.json` | Per-source scope map `{source_key: "global"\|"local"}`. Default `local`. |
| `~/.mari/<repo-slug>-<hash8>/` | Personal workspace for one repo: tracked-ref config, personal settings, state DB, index catalog, local credentials. |
| `~/.mari/_global/` | Workspace for globally-scoped connectors (same shape as a repo workspace). |
| `~/.mari/skills/` | Vendored external skills (e.g. humanizer). |
| `<repo>/.mari/config.json` | Committed, team-shared config: tracked refs, detector settings, tags policy, edit-notify rules. Versioned with code. |
| `<repo>/.mari/config.local.json` | Personal, gitignored overrides (deep-merged over committed; `null` deletes a key). |
| `<repo>/.mari/catalog/` | (git cloud backend only) shared index catalog, data files on Git LFS. |
| `<repo>/PRODUCT.md` | Editorial context: audience, register, voice, banned words, reading-grade target. |
| `<repo>/STYLE.md` | House style: base guide, terminology table, formatting rules, forbidden phrasings, glossary. |
| `<repo>/FACTS.md` | Facts ledger: one fact per line, `- fact  (source)`. |

Workspace identity: `<repo-slug>-<first-8-hex-of-hash(abs-path)>`.

### 3.2 Scopes

Every connector is scoped `global` (one index shared across all repos, lives in `_global`) or `local` (per-repo). Defaults per source are listed in §6.

Searches automatically union the repo workspace and `_global` whenever any connector is global; results dedupe by `(source, doc_id, chunk_id)`.

### 3.3 Config resolution

Effective config = deep-merge, later wins:

```
DEFAULTS → ~/.mari/config.json → <repo>/.mari/config.json
```

List-valued tracked refs **union** across layers; scalars from more-personal layers win. `chunking` resolves as global `chunking` with `<source>.chunking` merged on top. `mari config set` coerces values to the type of the default at that dotted path (booleans accept `1/true/yes/on`).

---

## 4. Configuration schema

Complete key registry with defaults. All keys settable via `mari config set <dotted.path> <value>` and readable via `mari config get`.

### 4.1 Indexing & embedding

```
embedding.batch_size          = 64
embedding.gpu_layers          = 999       # GPU layers to offload (clamped; CPU fallback)
embedding.auto_download       = true      # fetch the GGUF on first sync
embedding.model               = ""        # path override for air-gapped installs
chunking.lines                = 40        # lines per window
chunking.overlap              = 8         # shared lines between windows
chunking.max_chars            = 2000
chunking.min_chars            = 40        # windows shorter than this are dropped
chunking.title_prefix         = true      # prepend doc title to EMBEDDED text only
chunking.large_chunks         = false     # coarse vector-only chunks
chunking.large_chunk_ratio    = 4         # base chunks joined per large chunk
```

Per-source chunking overrides (defaults ship for chat-like sources):

```
slack.chunking    = {lines:5, overlap:3, max_chars:1000, min_chars:20}
git.chunking      = {lines:15, overlap:3, max_chars:1000, min_chars:10}
```

Changing any `embedding.*` or `*.chunking.*` key prints a reminder to run `mari sync --rebuild`.

### 4.2 Search

```
search.hybrid          = true    # false = vector only
search.k               = 8       # default result count
search.rrf_k           = 60      # reciprocal-rank-fusion constant
search.keyword_pool    = 200     # candidate pool floor (actual pool = max(k*4, keyword_pool))
search.expand          = 1       # neighbor chunks per hit (only when merge_sections=false)
search.vector_weight   = 1.0
search.keyword_weight  = 1.0
search.auto_weight     = true    # query-type routing (§7.4)
search.recency_decay   = 0.0     # 0 = off; score *= max(1/(1+decay*age_years), recency_floor)
search.recency_floor   = 0.75
search.merge_sections  = true    # coalesce adjacent same-doc chunks into sections
search.rerank.enabled  = false
search.rerank.model    = <implementation-chosen cross-encoder id>
search.rerank.pool     = 40
search.tag_boosts      = {canonical: 1.15, draft: 0.9, stale: 0.7, deprecated: 0.5}   # §10.1
```

### 4.3 Sync, sources & OCR

```
sync.stale_days        = 7       # read commands warn when index older; 0 = never warn
slack.lookback_days    = 14      # first-sync backfill window (0 = all)
discord.lookback_days  = 14
gdocs.lookback_days    = 30
gdocs.comments         = true    # index Drive comments as separate docs
github.include         = ["issues","pulls"]
zendesk.brands         = []      # optional brand filter
ocr.backend            = "text"  # text (Rust-native default) | auto | ocr-model  (§8.6)
ocr.model              = "baidu/Unlimited-OCR"   # the only supported engine; no fallbacks
ocr.dpi                = 200
ocr.auto_install       = true    # provision OCR toolchain on first use
ocr.accept_remote_code = false   # acknowledge that model tiers run trust_remote_code=True (§7)
```

Any source block also accepts a per-block `lookback_days` override (resolution: source block → `<key>.lookback_days` → built-in default).

### 4.4 Cloud sharing

```
cloud.enabled  = false
cloud.backend  = "s3"       # s3 | git
cloud.bucket   = ""
cloud.prefix   = ""
cloud.region   = ""
```

### 4.5 Detector & editorial

```
detector.styleGuide     = "microsoft"   # microsoft | google | ap | chicago | plain
detector.ignoreRules    = []            # rule ids waived project-wide
detector.ignoreFiles    = []            # globs (repo-relative path OR basename; **, *, ? supported)
detector.ignoreValues   = {}            # {ruleId: [exact values to waive]}
detector.ignoreReasons  = {}            # {ruleId|glob|value: "reason"}
detector.zeroTolerance  = []            # rule ids that fire on FIRST occurrence, bypassing density gates
detector.grammar        = false         # opt-in grammar pass (§11.7)
```

Waivers live **only** in config JSON — there are no inline in-file disable comments.

### 4.6 Hook

```
hook.maxFindings  = 20      # per-file cap in hook output
hook.grammar      = false
```

### 4.7 Edit-notify rules & nudges

```
rules  = [ {name, paths: [globs], notify: "message", exclude: [globs]} ]
nudges = [ {name,
            when:    {path: "<glob>", symbol: "<symbol>"?},     # trigger (source)
            edit:    [{path: "<file>", symbol: "<symbol>"?}],   # targets (sinks)
            message: "…"?,                                      # optional context for the agent
            exclude: [globs]?} ]
```

When any edited file matches a rule's `paths` and none of `exclude`, the post-edit hook reminds the agent to do `notify`.

A **nudge** is stronger: when an edited file matches `when` (and none of `exclude`), the hook directs the agent to **edit** each `edit` target now — a directed edit obligation, not just a reminder. The hook itself still never modifies files (§15.1 invariants); the agent makes the edits in-session.

**Span scoping via `symbol`.** Either side may name a symbol, written `path#symbol` on the CLI:
- in code files — an exported function/class/const name, resolved to its definition span with the same symbol extraction lineage proposals use (§8.3);
- in markdown — a heading, resolved to its section span (§11.0.4).

With `when.symbol` set, the nudge fires only when the edit intersects that span, not on any edit to the file. A `symbol` on an `edit` target scopes *what* to edit there ("update the `## Rate limits` section", not "touch the file somewhere"). Symbols re-resolve at hook time, so nudges survive file rewrites where line-based spans would drift; a symbol that no longer resolves falls back to whole-file matching with a warning.

A nudge is the hand-declared counterpart of a confirmed lineage edge (§8.3): the same span↔span maintenance promise, but stated by name/glob up front instead of curated from machine proposals, and matched by symbol rather than by line span + content hash. Both `rules` and `nudges` live in committed `.mari/config.json` — team-shared.

### 4.8 Curation

```
tags.statuses  = ["canonical","stale","deprecated","draft","internal","customer-facing","needs-review"]
tags.entries   = {}    # {path-or-doc-ref: {status, by, at, note}}  — committed config; team-shared
facts.file     = "FACTS.md"
glossary.file  = "STYLE.md"   # glossary terms live in STYLE.md's Terminology section
```

### 4.9 Scan / attention / associations

```
scan.google.docs        = []
scan.google.folders     = []
scan.slack.channels     = []
scan.slack.lookbackDays = 14
assoc.attn              = 0.5    # attention blend weight for assoc scoring
```

---

## 5. Command reference

Conventions for all commands:

- **Exit codes:** `0` success; `1` runtime/operation error or "no results"; `2` usage error / unknown argument. Detector-family commands: non-zero when any `error` finding exists.
- Mutating commands print `✓`/`✗` result lines; read commands print results or a "no matches — have you run mari sync?" nudge.
- Read commands (`search recent doc thread neighbors related sql`) auto-pull the cloud replica first when cloud-enabled; on failure they warn to stderr and read the stale replica. They also warn to stderr when index age ≥ `sync.stale_days`.

### 5.1 Setup & lifecycle

#### `mari init [search|style|all]` (default `all`)
Interactive, assistant-guided setup.
- `search`: prints connection status for every source. Per source: `[x]/[ ]`, label, scope, connection state or the exact `mari auth <provider>` command, credential file path and required fields, config file path and list keys, auto-index behavior, and current `lookback` where applicable. Ends with scope guidance and the three credential-handling paths (assistant runs it / user runs it / user writes the credential file).
- `style`: one-time editorial setup — ask register + base style guide, sample existing writing for voice, write `PRODUCT.md`, offer `STYLE.md`, offer hook install and `mari rules discover`.
- Exit 0.

#### `mari status`
Prints: workspace dir; cloud role/remote/last-pull (if cloud); embedding identity (warns on model mismatch → suggest `mari sync --rebuild`); last-sync age + staleness warning; per-source line `label scope connected|local tracked=N indexed=M`; detector style guide + hook state; tag counts by status. Tag counts are logical counts: a committed `tags.entries` item that has already been mirrored into the DuckDB `tags` table is counted once, not once from config plus once from the mirror.

#### `mari auth <provider> [--token T] [--url U] [--email E] [--subdomain S] [--key K] [--secret S] [--method M]`
Providers: `confluence discord github google hubspot jira linear microsoft salesforce slack zendesk`. (Auth provider `google` maps to source key `gdocs`.) Interactive providers (`google`, `microsoft`) with no flags run a browser/device-code flow; others validate the supplied credential against the service and save it to the source's scope location. Exit `0`/`1` (connect error)/`2` (unknown provider or missing required field).

#### `mari scope [source] [global|local]`
No args → list all sources and scopes. One arg → print that source's scope. Two args → change scope per §3.2.

#### `mari config [get PATH | set PATH VALUE | list] [--json]`
`get` prints the JSON value at a dotted path. `list` (or bare `mari config`) prints the whole resolved config, annotated with where each value can be set. `set` writes to global config with type coercion; prints a `--rebuild` reminder when the path touches `embedding.*` or `*.chunking.*`. Unknown path → prints all known dotted paths, exit 2.

#### `mari features [--json]`
Self-description catalog: every capability grouped by intent, with the command that provides it. (Used by the skill to answer "what can Mari do?")

#### `mari hooks <status|on|off|reset|ignore-rule <id>|ignore-file <glob>|ignore-value <rule> <value>> [--reason "…"]`
Hook management + hook-scoped waivers.

#### `mari ignores <list|add-rule <id>|add-file <glob>|add-value <rule> <value>> [--reason "…"]`
Detector waivers, written to committed `.mari/config.json`.

#### `mari zero <list|add <rule-id>|remove <rule-id>>`
Zero-tolerance list. A zero-tolerance rule fires on the first occurrence, bypassing density/co-occurrence gates. No-op for whole-document aggregate rules (`uniform-cadence`, `reading-grade`).

#### `mari rules <list|discover [--json] [--write]|add <name> --paths "<globs>" --notify "<msg>" [--exclude "<globs>"]|remove <name>>`
Edit-notify rules (§4.7). `discover` scans the repo for code↔docs couplings (API code ↔ API docs, config ↔ config reference, …) and proposes rules; `--write` saves them.

#### `mari nudge <list [--json]|add <name> --when "<glob>[#symbol]" --edit "<file>[#symbol]" [--edit "…"]… [--message "…"] [--exclude "<globs>"]|remove <name>|check [--json]>`
Nudges (§4.7): directed edit obligations — when a file matching `--when` is edited, the agent is told to edit every `--edit` target. `--edit` is repeatable (one nudge, many targets). `#symbol` scopes either side to a code symbol's definition span or a markdown heading's section. `add` validates that every named symbol resolves — unresolvable → `✗` + exit 1. `check` re-verifies all endpoints (files exist, symbols still resolve), for CI; exit 1 on any broken endpoint. Written to committed `.mari/config.json`.

### 5.2 Knowledge: sync & retrieval

#### `mari track <source> <add|remove|list> [ref] [--list-key <key>]`
Writes tracked refs to committed `.mari/config.json`. `list` prints every list key for the source. `add`/`remove` mutate one source list; when a source has multiple list keys, `--list-key` selects the exact key (`google.folders`, `microsoft.teams`) or a unique suffix (`folders`, `teams`). Without `--list-key`, the source's first list key is used for backward-compatible shorthand. Unknown source or list key exits 2.

#### `mari sync [source] [--rebuild] [--since N]`
Sync tracked sources into the index. The last sync time should be injected to remind the user to resync if too much time has gone by.
- `source` — restrict to one source key.
- Unknown source key exits 2 before opening or mutating a catalog.
- `--since N` — limit fetch/re-embed work to items modified in the last N days; deletions are still reconciled from the full local file set where the connector can enumerate it.
- `--rebuild` — full resweep: ignore cursors, re-fetch back `--since` days, re-embed every stored doc. Unsupported on a cloud consumer/cloud index (rebuild locally, then re-`cloud init`).
Runs local-scoped sources into the repo workspace, global-scoped into `_global`. Per-doc progress to stderr. Summary: `✓ N document(s) updated, M removed — C chunk(s) embedded.` Git-backed cloud writer prints a "commit .mari" nudge. Exit 1 if any source errored (other sources still complete).

#### `mari search "question" [flags]`
Hybrid search (§7). Flags:
- `--full [N]` — print full bodies capped at N chars/hit (bare `--full` = 4000; `--full 0` = uncapped). Default off = 5-line × 110-char preview.
- `--variant "<q>"` — repeatable; extra query phrasings fused via weighted RRF (main query weight 1.0, each variant 0.7). The **agent** is the query-expansion step; Mari never calls an LLM for it.
- `--k N` — result count (default `search.k`).
- `--source <key>` — restrict to one source.
- `--doc <substr>` — restrict to docs whose id/title contains substring.
- `--author <substr>`, `--since YYYY-MM-DD`, `--before YYYY-MM-DD` — metadata filters.
- `--tag <status>` / `--no-tag <status>` — filter by curation tag (e.g. `--tag canonical`, `--no-tag deprecated`).
- `--expand N` — neighbor chunks per hit (only when `search.merge_sections=false`).
- `--json`.
Empty result → nudge + exit 1. Hits show curation tag badges when tagged.

#### `mari explore "<question-or-file>" [--k N] [--json] [--deep] [--focus]`
Skill-facing repository/knowledge explorer. A question delegates to the deterministic search surface with stable JSON/human output. A file path uses the file path, title, and local symbols as the query. `--deep`/`--focus` are accepted and degrade loudly when the attention tier is unavailable.

#### `mari surface [dir] [--json]`
Prints the extracted public API/documentation surface for the repo or directory: Rust `pub` items, JS/TS/Python/Go exported symbols, Markdown headings, config keys, and command-like code spans with file and line. Used by `docsite`, `check --deep`, and the agent to ground documentation work.

#### `mari recent [--source] [--doc] [--author] [--since] [--before] [--tag S] [--no-tag S] [--limit N] [--full [N]]`
Most recently changed docs/messages, sorted by `COALESCE(modified_at, fetched_at) DESC`. `--limit` default 20.

#### `mari doc <ref> [--source S] [--full N]`
Full document body for up to 5 best id/title matches. `--full` default 0 (uncapped).

#### `mari thread <ref> [--source S] [--full N]`
Whole thread/conversation as one block (alias of `doc` for threaded sources).

#### `mari neighbors <chunk-id> [--radius N] [--full N]`
Chunks surrounding a chunk id in document order. `--radius` default 3.

#### `mari related <ref> [--source] [--limit N] [--full N]`
Docs one hop away in the edge graph (§8.4) from the best id/title match; each hit carries a `reason` (shared author / repo / project / channel / link). `--limit` default 20.

#### `mari sql "SELECT …" [--global]`
Read-only SQL over the DuckDB catalog (`SELECT`/`WITH`/`SHOW`/`DESCRIBE` only, else exit 2). No query → prints the catalog path. Tables and views are the §8.7 schema: `schema_meta`, `sources`, `documents`, `chunks`, `embeddings`, `spans`, `symbols`, `edges`, `lineage_edges`, `facts`, `tags`, `sync_events`, `navigation_targets`, and `graph_edges`. Output is tabular text for humans and stable enough for agent inspection.

#### `mari cloud <init|connect|role> … [--force]`
See §9.

### 5.3 Curation

#### `mari tag <path-or-ref> <status> [--note "…"] | mari tag list [--status S] [--json] | mari tag remove <path-or-ref>`
Tag a repo file or an indexed doc ref with one status from `tags.statuses` (`canonical stale deprecated draft internal customer-facing needs-review`). Tags are stored in committed `.mari/config.json` (`tags.entries`) so they are team-shared and versioned, and mirrored into the catalog `tags` table immediately when the indexed doc is present, and again at sync/search time. Effects:
- **Search ranking:** fused scores multiply by `search.tag_boosts` (canonical up-ranked; stale/deprecated down-ranked). `--tag`/`--no-tag` filters available on `search`/`recent`.
- **Result display:** tag badge shown on every hit; `deprecated` hits print their replacement pointer if a lineage edge exists.
- **Factcheck trust:** claims supported only by `stale`/`deprecated` sources are reported as `unsupported-claim` with a "source is stale" note; `canonical` sources are preferred evidence.
- **Hooks:** editing a file tagged `deprecated` or `stale` produces an advisory notice; `needs-review` files are surfaced by `mari audit kb`.

#### `mari glossary [harvest|list|add <term> --use "<canonical>" --not "<variants,…>"]`
Manages the Terminology table in STYLE.md.
- `harvest` — agent-driven: mine canonical terms and observed variants from the repo + knowledge base, propose Use/Not rows.
- `list` — print current terms.
- `add` — append a row.
Glossary rows feed the `terminology-consistency` detector rule (§11.3), so approved terms are enforced deterministically.

#### `mari facts <list|add "<fact>" [--source "<ref>"]>`
Manages `FACTS.md` (one fact per line: `- fact  (source)`). `mari extract` (below) is the bulk path.

#### `mari extract facts [--source <key>] [--doc <substr>] [--since D] [--json]`
Agent-assisted: pull candidate factual statements (numbers, dates, pricing, limits, launch claims) from recent knowledge-base content (e.g. `/mari extract facts from recent slack messages in #product`); the agent reviews and writes accepted ones to FACTS.md via `mari facts add`.

#### `mari audit kb [path…] [--json] [--strict]`
Knowledge-base audit. Finds: stale pages (no update past threshold), contradiction candidates (near-duplicate embeddings, plus NLI contradiction when models are available), missing links, duplicated content, unsupported claims, inconsistent terminology, the `needs-review` backlog, and content diverging from PRODUCT.md. Produces a prioritized report; does not edit.

### 5.4 Editorial: detector & rewriting

#### `mari detect <path|.> [--stdin] [flags]`
The deterministic detector. Reads markdown only (`.md .markdown .mdx .mdc`); non-markdown file args print a note and are skipped; no args → walk `.`.
- `--json` — findings + summary (+ score block with `--score`).
- `--summary` — worst files + rule histogram (for large trees).
- `--score` — 0–100 slop score with breakdown (§12).
- `--strict` — fail on `warn` too.
- `--quiet` — findings only, no banner.
- `--style=<microsoft|google|ap|chicago|plain>` — per-run pack override.
- `--models` — enable local ML tier (machine-likelihood, NLI; §17).
- `--slop-spans` — zero-shot slop-span extraction (requires `--models`).
- `--grammar` — opt-in grammar pass.
- `--no-config` — ignore project config.
Tree-walk skips: `node_modules .git dist build .next coverage .mari testdata test-data fixtures __fixtures__ golden snapshots __snapshots__ target out vendor vendored 3rdparty thirdparty third_party third-party`; also skips non-Latin/CJK prose, data-like files (few sentences, 2000+ char lines), generated files (CHANGELOG/HISTORY/LICENSE/NOTICE/llms.txt), and localized translation files. Code blocks, front matter (YAML/TOML), HTML comments, and template shortcodes are masked before rules run. Findings shape: `{ruleId, family, severity, offset, length, span, message, ref?}`.

#### `mari audit [path]`
Human-facing detector report grouped by family, each finding paired with a bad→good example fix. Report only; no edits.

#### `mari narrative <questions|score <file>> [--json]`
Whole-document narrative questionnaire for `deslop --narrative` (§13.3). `questions` prints the seven dimensions and register gates. `score` reads one file and returns a deterministic 0–35 report with per-dimension evidence. The score is a review aid, not an authorship claim: it identifies document-level risks such as stated morals, repeated frames, vague allusion, absent concessions, and flat time. Docs and microcopy apply only dimensions 1, 3, and 5 during agent editing, even though the CLI can print the full report for inspection.

#### Agent editorial verbs (run through the skill, backed by `mari detect` before/after)
Each verb has an authoritative reference flow the skill loads (§13). All preserve author meaning and voice; "rewrite, not delete"; each finishes by re-running the detector to verify no regression.

`deslop` (strip AI tells; `--narrative` adds discourse tier §13.3) · `understate` (cut over-explanation — the #1 durable tell) · `tighten` (concision) · `clarify` (jargon, acronyms, passive→active, error-message formula) · `sharpen` (cut hedges/weasels, commit to claims without inflating) · `soften` (superlatives→checkable facts) · `critique` (score 1–5 on argument/clarity/voice-fidelity/reader-experience; no rewrite) · `polish` (final pass: resolve critique + findings error→warn→advisory, align to STYLE.md, read aloud) · `voice` (inject brand voice from PRODUCT.md) · `cadence` (vary rhythm, thin tricolons) · `format` (headings, lists, emphasis, link text, backticks) · `delight` (restrained human touches) · `harden` (edge-case microcopy, error formula, i18n expansion budget ~30%) · `adapt` (rework for another channel) · `localize` (prep for translation + global English) · `draft` (outline→write→self-deslop→detect) · `outline` (annotated outline only) · `document` (infer STYLE.md from good existing writing) · `humanize` (apply vendored humanizer skill, then re-detect).

#### `mari humanize [ensure|update|status] [--json]`
Vendored external humanizer skill management: `ensure` clones on first use into `~/.mari/skills/humanizer` and prints the SKILL.md path; `update` fetches + hard-resets that checkout only; `status` prints revision.

### 5.5 Grounding

#### `mari factcheck <file> [flags]`
Checks the file's claims against ground truth. Depths:
1. **Deterministic (default):** typed-span extraction (number, money, percent, year, date, entity) matched against `FACTS.md` (or `--source <file>` e.g. `--source PRODUCT.md`, or `--kb` to ground against canonical-tagged knowledge-base docs from the repo workspace plus `_global`).
2. **`--models`:** adds local NLI entailment/contradiction.
3. **`--decompose` / `--claims <file>`:** atomic-claim grounding. `--emit-claim-targets` prints candidate sentences as JSON; the **agent** decomposes them into atomic claims in-session (the CLI never calls an LLM) and feeds them back via `--claims`.
4. **`--deep` / `--ground=attention` [--threshold t]:** on-device attention grounding of each sentence against the source (requires `--source` and a configured local model).
Other flags: `--json --strict --quiet --lookback`. Finding rules: `number-date-mismatch` (error), `contradicts-fact` (error), `unsupported-claim` (warn/advisory), `ungrounded-span` (advisory). Sources tagged `stale`/`deprecated` cannot *support* a claim (§5.3).

### 5.6 Documentation systems

#### `mari asset <detect <file> | check <file> [--strict] | scaffold <type> [title] [--force]>`
Document archetypes: `runbook adr postmortem rfc contributing code-of-conduct governance security` (canonical sections and rubrics in §14). `detect` infers the type; `check` validates required sections (`asset-missing-section`, plus `postmortem-blame` for blame language in postmortems); `scaffold` writes a template and refuses to overwrite unless `--force` is passed.

#### `mari platform <detect | list [--json] | scaffold <id> [--name "<title>"] [--force]>`
Doc-platform detection and scaffolding. Scaffoldable: `mkdocs docusaurus sphinx hugo jekyll mdbook antora docsify`. Detect-only: `vitepress starlight gitbook readthedocs`. Refuses to scaffold a second platform or overwrite without `--force`.

#### `mari check [--json] [--strict] [--deep [--limit N] [--threshold 0.3]]`
Whole-project docs validation: internal links + anchors resolve; nav↔files agree; community-health files present (README/LICENSE/CONTRIBUTING required; CODE_OF_CONDUCT/SECURITY/CHANGELOG recommended) and structurally valid. Rules: `link-broken`, `nav-missing-target`, `nav-orphan-page`, `community-missing-file`, `community-invalid-file`, plus asset rules. Respects `ignoreRules` but **not** `ignoreFiles` (structural defects can't be hidden by prose waivers). `--deep` adds attention passes over the public API surface: undocumented symbols and doc sentences anchored to nothing.

#### `mari docsite <plan|status> [--json]` (agent flow; entry via pin or `/mari docsite`)
`plan` prints the seven deterministic phases and grounding commands. `status` inspects the repository for an existing platform, docs directory, community-health files, hook configuration, and edit-notify rules. The CLI does not generate prose or call an LLM; page writing remains agent-owned and must be grounded in `mari surface`, `mari explore`, and the DuckDB catalog.

Seven phases: survey codebase → choose platform (`mari platform`) → design IA (Diátaxis) → write every page grounded in code (`mari surface`, `mari explore`) → community-health files (license copied verbatim, everything else templated with `<placeholders>`) → validate `mari check --strict` (+ `--deep`) → keep alive (hook + `rules discover` + CI gate).

### 5.7 Localization

#### `mari i18n <file>`
List a file's translations/source across supported localization layouts (suffix `README.es.md`; dir `docs/{en,fr}/`; Hugo `content.zh`; Docusaurus `i18n/<lang>/...`).

`mari localize` is an alias for the same deterministic localization command surface. Agent editorial localization still runs through the `localize` verb and uses these checks before/after edits.

#### `mari i18n conform <file|dir> [--deep [--limit N]] [--strict]`
Check translations share the source's structure (headings, code blocks, links). Directory = one-pass sweep. `--deep` adds attention prose-coverage.

#### `mari i18n coverage <source> [translation]`
Attention pass: flag source passages the translation barely covers.

The post-edit hook raises an i18n staleness note when a source-language file with siblings is edited (e.g. editing `docs/en/pricing.md` flags `docs/es/pricing.md`, `docs/fr/pricing.md`).

## 6. Connectors

### 6.0 Common contract

Each source defines: `key`, config block, label, tracked-ref list keys, auth provider (or none), scope default, sync function, and flags `interactive_auth` / `always_when_connected`. A source is **active** when it has tracked refs OR (`always_when_connected` AND connected). Registry order: cloud connectors → `git` → discovered plugins → `localfiles` **last** (path catch-all).

Shared sync semantics:
- **Change detection:** per-doc revision signal (listed per source) decides *fetch*; a 16-hex content hash is the final authority for *re-embed* — a revision bump with identical text updates metadata only.
- **Resumable embedding:** docs whose `embedded_hash != hash` re-embed oldest-first; checkpoint per doc, so interrupted syncs resume cleanly.
- **Error tolerance:** one bad doc is logged and skipped; one source's failure never aborts others; a tracked-but-unconnected source (common from committed config) is a nudge, not an error.
- **HTTP:** retries 429 and ≥500 up to 4 attempts honoring `Retry-After` (else exponential backoff); 401 → one token-refresh attempt then auth error; 60s timeout.
- **Lookback:** chat-like sources backfill `lookback_days` on first sync (0 = all); `--rebuild` reaches `--since` days.
- **Pruning:** item-tracked sources prune docs that vanish or whose ref was untracked; incremental/whole-collection sources (Zendesk tickets, Salesforce, HubSpot, Microsoft mail/Teams) never prune.

### 6.1 Slack — `slack` · lists `channels` · auth `slack` · default scope **global** · always-when-connected
- **Credential:** User OAuth token `xoxp-…` (sees DMs + private channels) or Bot token `xoxb-…` (invited channels only). Scopes: `channels:history groups:history im:history mpim:history channels:read groups:read users:read`. Missing `groups:read` degrades to public channels (logged, not fatal). Stored: `{token, team, user, url}`.
- **Documents:** one per thread (root + replies), one per standalone message. `doc_id = <channel>/<root_ts>`; URL = permalink; author + created/modified (last activity).
- **Tracking:** default = all channels the token is a member of; explicit `channels` list (or `all`/`*`) narrows.
- **Incremental:** per-channel timestamp cursor + trailing 7-day re-scan window (catches edits/late replies). First sync backfills 14 days. User directory cached in state.

### 6.2 Google Drive — `gdocs` · config block `google` · lists `docs, folders` · auth `google` · interactive · default **global** · always-when-connected
- **Credential:** rides the user's gcloud session (browser sign-in with Drive access; per-sync short-lived access token, cached ~50 min). No OAuth client or GCP project required. Stored: `{method: gcloud, account}`.
- **Documents:** Google Docs exported as Markdown (fallback plain text); PDFs downloaded and text-extracted (§8.6). With nothing tracked, auto-indexes docs+PDFs the user owns; explicit `docs`/`folders` (Drive URLs; folders crawled recursively) narrow and disable auto-index.
- **Comments:** with `gdocs.comments=true`, each Drive comment (+replies) is a separate doc `<fileId>#comment:<id>`, author-attributed, mime `text/x-comment`.
- **Incremental:** per-file head-revision id; auto-mode discovery cursor on newest modified time; first sync 30-day lookback (0 = all); already-indexed files persist past the window; trash/access-loss evicts.

### 6.3 GitHub — `github` · lists `repos` · auth `github` · default **local**
- **Credential:** fine-grained PAT (`github_pat_…`; read: Contents, Issues, Pull requests, Metadata) or classic (`ghp_…`; `repo`/`public_repo`). Stored: `{token, login}`.
- **Documents:** issues + PRs (title, body, comments) of tracked repos. `github.include` narrows to `["issues"]`/`["pulls"]`. `doc_id = owner/repo#N`. No auto-index; must track ≥1 repo. No lookback.
- **Incremental:** per-repo `updated_at` high-water cursor; prunes untracked repos' docs.

### 6.4 Git history — `git` · lists `repos` · **no auth** · default **local** · always-when-connected
- Shells out to local `git log`. With nothing tracked, indexes the cwd repo; `repos` adds other clones. One document per commit; `doc_id = <repo>:<sha>`; URL derived from origin remote when GitHub/GitLab-shaped. Chat-sized chunking.
- **Incremental:** last-HEAD cursor, reads `last..HEAD`; rebase/force-push triggers full scan and prune of vanished commits.

### 6.5 Confluence — `confluence` · lists `spaces, pages` · auth `confluence` · default **local**
- **Credential:** Cloud = email + API token (Basic; URL includes `/wiki`); Server/DC = PAT (Bearer). Method inferred from presence of `--email`. Stored: `{method, url, email, token, name}`.
- **Documents:** every page, storage HTML flattened to text, `# title` prepended. Refs: page/space URL, `confluence:SPACEKEY`, `confluence:page:<id>`. Must track ≥1. `doc_id` = page id.
- **Incremental:** version number; list endpoint carries metadata, bodies fetched lazily for changed pages; prunes unseen pages.

### 6.6 Jira — `jira` · lists `projects` · auth `jira` · default **local**
- **Credential:** as Confluence (Cloud Basic / DC PAT), URL without trailing path.
- **Documents:** one per issue (summary + description + comments). Refs: `jira:PROJ` or `/browse/PROJ-123` URL. `doc_id` = issue key; author = reporter. Must track ≥1.
- **Incremental:** per-project `updated >` cursor; prunes untracked projects.

### 6.7 Zendesk — `zendesk` · lists `include` · auth `zendesk` · default **global** · always-when-connected
- **Credential:** subdomain + email + API token (Basic `email/token:token`). Stored: `{subdomain, email, token, name}`.
- **Documents:** tickets (subject + description + public/internal comments) and help-center articles (HTML→text). Both index once connected; `include` narrows to `zendesk:tickets`/`zendesk:articles`; optional `zendesk.brands` filter. `doc_id` = `ticket/<id>` / `article/<id>`.
- **Incremental:** tickets via incremental-export epoch cursor; articles paged in full; **never prunes**.

### 6.8 Salesforce — `salesforce` · lists `objects` · auth `salesforce` · default **global** · always-when-connected
- **Credential:** OAuth access token + instance URL (via Salesforce CLI, a Connected App, or an existing session). Tokens short-lived, not refreshed — re-auth on 401. Stored: `{token, url, name}`.
- **Documents:** Knowledge articles + Cases via SOQL. `objects` narrows to `salesforce:articles`/`salesforce:cases`. Whole-collection: never prunes; re-embeds when last-modified advances. `doc_id` = `article/<Id>` / `case/<Id>`.

### 6.9 HubSpot — `hubspot` · lists `include` · auth `hubspot` · default **global** · always-when-connected
- **Credential:** private-app token `pat-…` (Bearer; read scopes Tickets, Notes/engagements, Knowledge Base). Stored: `{token, portal_id}`.
- **Documents:** tickets, notes (HTML→text), KB articles (tolerated-if-absent). `include` narrows to `hubspot:tickets`/`hubspot:notes`/`hubspot:kb`. Whole-collection: never prunes. Cursor-paged; revision = `updatedAt`.

### 6.10 Microsoft 365 — `microsoft` · lists `drives, mail, teams` · auth `microsoft` · interactive · default **global**
- **Credential:** device-code flow against the public Azure CLI client (no app registration/admin consent; refresh token stored and rotated), or reuse an existing `az` session. Scopes: `offline_access Files.Read.All Mail.Read Chat.Read Sites.Read.All User.Read`.
- **Documents:** OneDrive/SharePoint files (office/pdf/html/text extraction; refs `me`, drive id, `ms:file:<itemId>`); Outlook mail — one doc per conversation (refs `ms:mail:<folder>`); Teams — one doc per message (refs `ms:teams:<teamId>/<channelId>`). Must track ≥1.
- **Incremental:** files by eTag/lastModified (files prune on delete); mail by newest received time; Teams messages carry no revision. Mail and Teams never prune.

### 6.11 Discord — `discord` · lists `channels, guilds` · auth `discord` · default **global**
- **Credential:** bot token; bot invited with View Channels + Read Message History and the **Message Content intent**. Stored: `{token, name, id}`.
- **Documents:** one per message in tracked channels (`discord:<channelId>` or URL) and all text channels of tracked guilds (`discord:guild:<id>`). Text channel types `{0,5,10,11,12}`. Must track ≥1. `doc_id = <channelName>/<messageId>`.
- **Incremental:** per-channel timestamp cursor, backward snowflake pagination; 14-day first-sync lookback.

### 6.12 Local files — `localfiles` · lists `paths` · no auth · default **local** · always last
- `paths` = files or folders (recursive; dotfiles/dot-dirs skipped). Formats: markdown/text (`.md .markdown .mdown .mkd .mkdn .mdx .txt .text .rst .org .adoc .asciidoc .asc .textile .tex .me`), HTML (`.html .htm .xhtml`), Office (`.docx .docm .odt .fodt .rtf .pptx .xlsx`), PDF. **Deliberately excludes logs and source code.**
- Change detection: mtime, content hash authoritative. Prunes vanished files. `doc_id` = absolute path; URL `file://…`.

### 6.13 Linear — `linear` · lists `teams, projects` · auth `linear` · default **local**
(Named in PRODUCT.md; not in the prototypes. Specified to the GitHub/Jira pattern.)
- **Credential:** personal API key. Stored: `{token, name}`.
- **Documents:** one per issue (title + description + comments). Refs: `linear:TEAM`, issue/project URL. Must track ≥1. Incremental: per-team `updatedAt` cursor; prunes untracked teams.

## 7. Indexing & retrieval

### 7.1 Embedding
The only permitted embedding model identity is `qwen3-embedding-0.6b`. Encoded vectors are task-aware (distinct document vs query encoding) and normalized. `status` warns on mismatch with the index and recommends `mari sync --rebuild`. No silent fallback is allowed: if that model is unavailable, vector embedding fails loudly and keyword-only search may still run without writing `embeddings` rows.

### 7.2 Chunking
Fixed line windows: `lines` per window, `overlap` shared, step `max(1, lines−overlap)`; windows `< min_chars` dropped; each capped at `max_chars`. **Stable chunk ids** `<source>/<doc_id>#L<start>` (1-based) so unchanged docs re-embed nothing. `title_prefix` prepends the doc title to embedded text only (stored text stays raw). `large_chunks` joins every `large_chunk_ratio` base chunks into a coarse vector-only chunk (excluded from keyword and neighbor queries).

### 7.3 Hybrid retrieval
- **Vector:** cosine similarity over the chunk store; score `round(1 − distance, 3)`. ANN index built only past a row floor (~4096; partitions ≈ √rows capped 1024); brute-force below it. Scalar indexes on `source`/`doc_id`.
- **Keyword:** deterministic scoring directly over the same chunk store — count of distinct query terms present (tokens `[\w#/.-]{2,}`) plus a `+2` whole-phrase bonus. Excludes large chunks.
- **Fusion:** weighted reciprocal-rank fusion; each list contributes `weight/(rrf_k + rank)`. Main query weight 1.0, each `--variant` 0.7; vector/keyword lists weighted by config. Candidate pool `max(k*4, keyword_pool)`.

### 7.4 Auto weighting (query-type routing)
When `search.auto_weight`: identifier-like/quoted/short-numeric queries scale `vector×0.6, keyword×1.6`; natural-language questions (ends with `?`, or ≥5 tokens containing a question word) scale `vector×1.3, keyword×0.8`.

### 7.5 Post-fusion adjustments (applied in order)
1. **Filters:** source, doc-substring, author-substring, since/before on `modified_at` (accepted date forms: `YYYY-MM-DD`, ISO, `YYYY/MM/DD`), tag filters.
2. **Tag boosts:** multiply by `search.tag_boosts[status]` when the doc is tagged (§5.3).
3. **Recency:** if `recency_decay > 0`, multiply by `max(1/(1+decay*age_years), recency_floor)`; missing `modified_at` treated as ~0.25 years.
4. **Section merge** (`merge_sections`, default on): coalesce adjacent same-doc chunks into one section (line-range union, text from the doc body). When on, `--expand` is skipped.
5. **Rerank** (opt-in): local cross-encoder over the fused top-`pool` (default 40). Missing model → skipped, never fatal.
6. **Scope union & dedupe** across repo + `_global` workspaces.

### 7.6 Canned retrieval primitives
`recent` (newest first), `doc`/`thread` (full body, best id/title matches, limit 5), `neighbors` (± radius by chunk order), `related` (graph one-hop with reasons), `sql` (read-only).

### 7.7 Rust implementation candidates

| Mechanism | Crate(s) |
|---|---|
| Embedding inference | The only permitted model identity is `qwen3-embedding-0.6b`; use `candle` or `ort` + `tokenizers`, with `fastembed` acceptable only if it runs that exact model |
| Vector store + ANN (IVF-PQ, scalar indexes) | `lancedb` / `lance` (native Rust) |
| Keyword scoring over chunks | SQL via `duckdb` (bundled), or `tantivy` if a dedicated inverted index is preferred over the count-based scorer |
| Cross-encoder rerank | `fastembed` (TextCrossEncoder) or `ort` |
| Connector HTTP (retry/backoff per §6.0) | `reqwest` + `tokio`; `backoff` for the retry policy |
| Git history connector | `git2`, or shell out to `git log -z` exactly as specified |
| Date parsing (`--since`/`--before`, cursors) | `chrono` |

## 8. Data model & storage

### 8.1 Catalog tables (shared, syncable)
The authoritative v1 schema is §8.7. At the logical level:

- **sources** — connector identity, scope, config hash, and sync status.
- **documents** — one current extracted body per source-native document/path, keyed by `doc_id`, with `canonical_ref`, title, URL/path, version, hash, timestamps, and connector metadata.
- **chunks** — navigable byte/line windows over `documents.body`, with heading path, stable chunk id, token count, and text hash.
- **embeddings** — optional vector rows keyed by `chunk_id`; every row must use `qwen3-embedding-0.6b`. Keyword search works without this table, but no fallback embedding model is allowed.
- **spans** and **symbols** — precise byte/line ranges for headings, paragraphs, sentences, code symbols, config keys, commands, and other navigable targets.
- **edges** and **lineage_edges** — graph relationships and curated span↔span maintenance promises.
- **facts** and **tags** — grounding ledger rows and query-time mirrors of curation status.
- **sync_events** — audit trail for source sync attempts.
- **navigation_targets** and **graph_edges** — read-only views that flatten common joins for precise agent navigation.

### 8.2 Private state (per workspace, never shared)
Private state is stored in the same workspace DuckDB file, primarily in `schema_meta` and source-specific metadata columns. Required keys include `last_sync`, `embedding.model`, `embedding.dims`, chunking identity, extractor identity, and schema migration timestamps. `embedding.model` must be `qwen3-embedding-0.6b`; if that model is unavailable, vector embedding fails loudly and keyword-only search may still run without writing `embeddings` rows. Per-source cursors use namespaced keys such as `slack.cursor.<id>`, `github.since.<repo>`, `git.head.<root>`, and `localfiles.mtime.<path>` when the connector needs incremental state.

### 8.3 Lineage store (per repo)
Edge table: id, endpoints (`file`, `start`, `end`, content-hash at stamp time ×2), `rel`, `status ∈ {proposed, confirmed, rejected}`, score, provenance (`--by llm|human`), note, timestamps.

### 8.4 Deterministic edge graph
Built at sync, no LLM: `authored_by → person(author)`; container edges from doc_id shape — GitHub/git `in_repo`, Jira `in_project`, Slack/Discord `in_channel`; markdown links → `links_to`. Powers `related` and the tag replacement pointer.

### 8.5 Content extraction
- **HTML:** flattened to markdown-lite (headings, bullets, links); script/style/head dropped.
- **Office:** docx/docm/odt/fodt/rtf/pptx (shapes + tables + speaker notes, per-slide headings)/xlsx (computed values, per-sheet). Legacy binary `.doc`/`.ppt` unsupported.
- **PDF (§8.6):** `ocr.backend = text` (embedded text only) | `auto` (embedded text; OCR only pages with <16 extractable chars) | `ocr-model` (every page through the configured local OCR/VLM). OCR toolchain auto-provisioned on first use unless `ocr.auto_install=false`; runs on GPU or CPU; render DPI configurable.

### 8.6 Concurrency & durability
Index writes are atomic upserts/appends with commit-conflict retry (up to 5 attempts). SQL surface is read-only. Legacy-format catalogs migrate idempotently behind a state flag.

*Rust:* the v1 catalog and private state map to `duckdb` (bundled). LanceDB remains a later ANN/index-scale option; if added, the read-only `mari sql` surface registers the Lance datasets as DuckDB views via `duckdb`'s Arrow integration. SQLite/rusqlite is not a storage target. Office/PDF/HTML extraction: `zip` + `quick-xml` for docx/pptx/xlsx/odt, `pdfium-render` or `lopdf`+`pdf-extract` for PDF text, `scraper` or `html2text` for HTML flattening; the OCR fallback runs through the Tier-2 model runtime (§17).

### 8.7 DuckDB catalog schema

The v1 catalog is a single DuckDB database at `<workspace>/catalog.duckdb`. The schema is part of the product contract: every row must carry enough source, byte-span, version, and relationship metadata for `mari sql`, search, lineage, audits, and hooks to navigate from any result back to the exact source span.

All timestamps are UTC RFC 3339 strings. All byte offsets are UTF-8 byte offsets into `documents.body` after extraction/normalization, not character indexes. `*_json` columns are JSON strings when DuckDB JSON support is unavailable; otherwise they may be typed `JSON` with the same shape.

Required read-only views:

```sql
CREATE VIEW navigation_targets AS
SELECT target_type, target_id, doc_id, chunk_id, span_id, symbol_id,
       source_id, canonical_ref, title, url, path, kind,
       label, language, qualified_name,
       start_byte, end_byte, start_line, end_line, metadata_json
FROM (
  -- documents, chunks, spans, and symbols normalized into one navigable surface
);

CREATE VIEW graph_edges AS
SELECT edge_id, rel,
       from_type, from_id, from_doc_id, from_ref, from_path,
       to_type, to_id, to_doc_id, to_ref, to_path,
       confidence, evidence_span_id, created_by, created_at, metadata_json
FROM (
  -- edges with doc endpoints resolved to canonical refs and paths when possible
);
```

`navigation_targets` is the default SQL surface for "where exactly is this thing?" queries. `graph_edges` is the default SQL surface for "what does this thing relate to?" queries. Both views are derived from the base tables and must not hide first-class navigation fields only in JSON.

Minimum `schema_meta` keys:

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `schema.version` | Monotonic schema version. |
| `schema.created_at` | Catalog creation time. |
| `schema.migrated_at` | Last migration time. |
| `embedding.model` | Required embedding identity: `qwen3-embedding-0.6b`. |
| `embedding.dims` | Active embedding dimension count; `0` means no vector rows have been generated yet. |
| `chunking.version` | Chunking algorithm identity. |
| `extractor.version` | Extraction/normalization identity. |
| `last_sync` | Last successful sync completion time. |

Navigation requirements:

- A search result must expose `doc_id`, `chunk_id`, `canonical_ref`, `title`, `url/path`, `heading_path`, byte range, line range, score parts, and matching terms.
- A hook or lineage notice must be able to map an edited file and byte/line range to overlapping `spans`, `symbols`, `chunks`, confirmed `lineage_edges`, and `tags`.
- Every connector-specific field that is not first-class belongs in `metadata_json`, but first-class navigation fields above must not be hidden only in JSON.
- Deletions are represented by removing current rows after a sync event records `docs_deleted`; future tombstone support may add `deleted_at`, but v1 read surfaces show only current rows.

## 9. Team sharing (cloud)

One authoritative shared catalog per repo; every machine keeps a full local replica; **reads always run on the replica**.

- `mari cloud init --backend git [--force]` — catalog lives at `<repo>/.mari/catalog`, data files on Git LFS (a `.gitattributes` is written). This machine becomes writer; teammates are read-only consumers via normal git pulls. If the shared catalog already exists, init refuses to overwrite it unless `--force` is passed.
- `mari cloud connect --backend git` — read-only git consumer; copies the committed `<repo>/.mari/catalog/catalog.duckdb` into the local replica after a normal git pull.
- `mari cloud init --bucket B [--prefix P] [--region R] [--force]` — S3-backed writer; pushes the local index up.
- `mari cloud connect --bucket B [...]` — read-only consumer; pulls down.
- `mari cloud role <writer|consumer>` — set this machine's role.
- `mari pull` — fetch latest cloud index into the replica (errors if not cloud-enabled); read commands also auto-pull, throttled to once per 60s.

**One-writer rule:** exactly one writer per shared catalog (index versions don't merge). `--rebuild` is unsupported against a cloud index — rebuild locally, then re-init. The git backend's sync summary nudges the writer to commit `.mari`. Alternatively teams skip cloud entirely and let each member sync from sources directly (config lists are shared via committed `.mari/config.json`; embeddings stay per-machine).

## 10. Curation model

### 10.1 Tag statuses and semantics

| Status | Meaning | Search | Factcheck | Hook |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `canonical` | Source of truth | boost ×1.15 | preferred evidence | — |
| `draft` | Not yet trusted | ×0.9 | cannot support claims | — |
| `stale` | Known out of date | ×0.7 | cannot support; flagged | advisory on edit |
| `deprecated` | Superseded | ×0.5, shows replacement | contradiction candidate | advisory on edit |
| `internal` | Not customer-facing | badge only | — | warns if referenced from customer-facing docs |
| `customer-facing` | Published surface | badge only | held to `--strict` | stricter hook lint |
| `needs-review` | Flagged for a human | badge only | — | surfaced by `audit kb` |

Boost values are config (`search.tag_boosts`). Tags apply to repo paths and to indexed doc refs (`source:doc_id`).

### 10.2 Glossary
Approved terms live in STYLE.md's Terminology table (Use / Not columns). `mari glossary harvest` proposes rows from the repo + knowledge base; accepted rows are enforced by the `terminology-consistency` rule and loaded into the skill's editorial context.

### 10.3 Facts
FACTS.md is the deterministic grounding source: one fact per line with optional `(source)` attribution. Populated manually (`mari facts add`), or in bulk via `mari extract facts` (agent reviews before writing). Accepted ledger facts are mirrored into the catalog `facts` table when a catalog exists, with `status='accepted'`, source attribution, author, timestamp, and `metadata_json.source='FACTS.md'`. `factcheck` treats FACTS.md as ground truth; contradictions are errors.

## 11. Detector rule registry

This section specifies the complete deterministic detector: the text-processing engine, every rule's exact mechanic (pattern, word list, gate, severity), and — where a Rust library can carry the mechanic — the crate to use. Word lists are normative: an implementation must match these lists exactly (they are the tested, calibrated sets from the prototype; every entry has a fixture).

Conventions used throughout:

- **Rule shape:** `{id, family, defaultSeverity, pack?}` with a `run(ctx, emit)` body. `emit` records `{ruleId, family, severity, offset, length, span, message, ref?}`. `span` is the matched source text capped at 80 chars, whitespace-collapsed.
- **Families:** `A` ai-slop · `B` clarity · `C` style · `D` inclusive · `grounding` · `grammar`. Severities: `error > warn > advisory`.
- **Offsets always refer to the original text**; rules scan the *masked* text (same length, code blanked), so a finding always points at the right source position.
- **Density gates:** a density-gated rule never fires on a single match. Zero tolerance (`detector.zeroTolerance`) bypasses the gate and fires per occurrence; it is a no-op for whole-document aggregate rules (`uniform-cadence`, `reading-grade`) — there is no single occurrence to flag.
- **Pack gating:** a rule with `pack` runs only when `detector.styleGuide`/`--style` selects that pack.
- **Severity caps are deliberate** (e.g. `overused-word` never exceeds warn): meta-documents about writing quote slop words densely, and style judgments must not fail CI.
- **Case-insensitive matching** unless a rule states otherwise.

### 11.0 Engine mechanics

#### 11.0.1 Pipeline

For each markdown file: read → file-level skip checks (§11.0.6) → build `ctx` via segmentation (§11.0.2–11.0.4) → run every active rule (always-on + selected pack) → apply waivers (`ignoreRules`, `ignoreFiles`, `ignoreValues`) → sort and render. The context object exposes: `text`, `masked`, `locate(offset)→{line,col}`, `blocks`, `sentences`, `wordCount`, `countWords(s)`, `headings`, `listItems`, `links`, `images`, `boldSpans`, `thematicBreaks`, `tableLines`, `isTableLine(offset)`, `refDefs`, `refUses`, `styleGuide`, `zeroTolerance`.

#### 11.0.2 Masking

Code and metadata are replaced with **spaces of equal length** (newlines preserved) so offsets survive. Blanked regions, in order:

1. Front matter at file start: YAML `--- … ---` or TOML `+++ … +++`.
2. Fenced code blocks: ``` ``` … ``` ``` and `~~~ … ~~~`.
3. Inline code: `` `…` `` (single line).
4. HTML comments `<!-- … -->` (license headers, notes — not prose).
5. Template shortcodes `{{ … }}` (Hugo/Liquid: `{{< ref >}}`, `{{% %}}`, `{{ .Var }}`).
6. Inline HTML tags `</?[a-zA-Z][^>]*>`.

Two rules (`passive-voice`, `indefinite-article`) additionally verify that the matched span is byte-identical in `text` and `masked` — a mismatch means the match spans a blanked inline-code hole ("is \`RocksDB\` based" → "is … based") and must be discarded.

*Rust:* `pulldown-cmark` yields byte ranges for code blocks/inline code/HTML, which map directly onto this blanking approach; the front-matter and shortcode patterns are plain regexes.

#### 11.0.3 Segmentation

- **Word counting:** tokens matching `[A-Za-z0-9]+(?:['’-][A-Za-z0-9]+)*`.
- **Blocks:** the masked text splits on blank lines; a heading line (`^\s{0,3}#{1,6}\s`) or list-item line (`^\s*([-*+]|\d+[.)])\s`) is its own block; consecutive plain lines merge into one paragraph block.
- **Sentences** (within non-heading blocks): terminator regex `[.!?]+["')\]”’]?(\s+|$)`, with two suppressions — a decimal point (digit before, `.digit` after) and a trailing abbreviation from the set: `mr mrs ms dr prof sr jr st vs etc inc ltd co no fig al eg ie e.g i.e u.s u.k a.m p.m approx`. Trailing text after the last terminator is a final sentence if non-blank.
- **Sentence-start test** (`isSentenceStart`): walk left over `[ \t>*_#-]` (blockquote/list/emphasis markers); the position starts a sentence if the preceding significant char is `.!?` or a newline, or start-of-file.

*Rust:* the splitter is small enough to port verbatim; `unicode-segmentation` (UAX-29) is available but is *not* a drop-in — the abbreviation and decimal suppressions above are the behavior contract.

#### 11.0.4 Markdown structure extraction

From the raw + masked line pair (a line fully blanked by masking is skipped):

- **Headings:** `^(\s{0,3})(#{1,6})\s+(.*?)\s*#*\s*$` → `{level, text, line, start, raw}`.
- **List items:** `^(\s*)([-*+]|\d+[.)])\s+(.*)$` → `{indent, marker, text, line, start}`.
- **Images** (parsed first so links can skip them): `!\[alt\](target …)`.
- **Links:** `\[text\](target …)` not preceded by `!`; scanned over masked text so code-span links don't count.
- **Bold spans:** `\*\*…\*\*` or `__…__` (single line).
- **Thematic breaks:** `^\s{0,3}([-*_])(\s*\1){2,}\s*$` tested on the masked line (so front-matter `---` doesn't count).
- **Table lines** (a set of line numbers): a line starting with `|`, a separator row `:?-{2,}:?(\|…)+`, or any line containing ≥2 pipes. `isTableLine(offset)` gates many rules — data cells aren't prose.
- **Reference definitions** `^\s{0,3}\[id\]:\s+\S+` and **uses** `][id]` plus shortcut `[id]` (not followed by `[`, `(`, `:`; not an image).

*Rust:* `pulldown-cmark` (or `comrak`) supplies all of these with source ranges; the table-line set and thematic-break checks are line regexes.

#### 11.0.5 Matching helpers

- `wordList(words)` → one alternation regex `\b(w1|w2|…)\b` case-insensitive, entries regex-escaped. *Rust:* for large lists use `aho-corasick` (with `MatchKind::LeftmostLongest` + ASCII case-insensitive) and verify word boundaries at match edges; `regex`'s alternation literal optimization also compiles these to Aho-Corasick internally, so a single `regex::RegexBuilder` with `case_insensitive(true)` is equally acceptable.
- `phraseList(phrases)` → alternation sorted **longest-first**, guarded by lookarounds instead of `\b`: `(?<![A-Za-z0-9_])(…)(?![A-Za-z0-9_])` — keys may end in punctuation (`e.g.`, `etc.`) where a trailing `\b` never matches. *Rust:* lookbehind/lookahead require `fancy-regex` (the `regex` crate has no lookarounds); alternatively match with `aho-corasick` leftmost-longest and check the neighbor bytes manually (faster, no backtracking).
- `scan(ctx, re, cb)` → iterate all matches over `ctx.masked`, advancing one char on zero-width matches.
- `emitAt` → builds the ≤80-char whitespace-collapsed span from the *original* text.
- `zeroTol(ctx, id)` → membership in the config zero-tolerance set.

Rules that use regex lookbehind (and therefore `fancy-regex` or manual neighbor checks in Rust): `em-dash-overuse` (`(?<=\s)--(?=\s)`), `semicolon-overuse` (HTML-entity lookbehinds), `spell-out-small-numbers` / `ap-number-style` / `chicago-number-style` (`(?<![\w.$%/-])`), `large-number-grouping`, `ms-negative-number-endash` (`(?<=\s)`), `no-abbreviation-as-verb` (`(?<!use )(?<!using )`), `indefinite-article` (`(?<![&\w.])`), `bare-url` (`(?<![("'<=\]])`), reference shortcut uses (`(?<!\!)`).

#### 11.0.6 File-level skip heuristics

Applied before segmentation (already listed under `mari detect`, restated as the engine contract):

- Extensions: only `.md .markdown .mdx .mdc`.
- Skip directories: `node_modules .git dist build .next coverage .mari testdata test-data fixtures __fixtures__ golden snapshots __snapshots__ target out vendor vendored 3rdparty thirdparty third_party third-party`.
- Skip generated files: `CHANGELOG`, `HISTORY`, `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, `llms.txt`.
- **Non-Latin prose:** count Latin letters vs non-Latin script chars (CJK, Cyrillic, Arabic, Thai, Hangul ranges); skip when `nonLatin > 80 && nonLatin × 3 > latin` (≥25% of letters non-Latin — English rules are meaningless and half-translated docs would be pure noise).
- **Data-like files:** many words with almost no terminal punctuation, or lines ≥2000 chars.
- **Localized translation files** (per the i18n layout detection) are skipped — the source language is the lintable surface.

*Rust:* the `ignore` crate handles tree walking with the skip-dir set; `globset` implements `ignoreFiles` globs (repo-relative path OR basename, `**`/`*`/`?`). Parallelize per-file with `rayon`.

#### 11.0.7 Rust implementation candidates (engine-wide)

| Mechanism | Crate(s) |
|---|---|
| Plain regex rules (no lookaround) | `regex` |
| Lookbehind/lookaround rules (§11.0.5 list) | `fancy-regex` (or `aho-corasick` + manual edge checks) |
| Large word/phrase lists | `aho-corasick` (leftmost-longest, ASCII case-insensitive) |
| Markdown structure + masking ranges | `pulldown-cmark` (or `comrak`) |
| Tree walk + skip dirs | `ignore` |
| Waiver globs | `globset` |
| Per-file parallelism | `rayon` |
| Config (JSON, deep-merge) | `serde` / `serde_json` |
| CLI surface | `clap` |
| TTY color | `anstream` + `owo-colors` |
| Grammar pass | `harper-core` (Harper is native Rust; no WASM needed — §11.11) |
| Syllables/readability | port §11.12 verbatim (no crate dependency needed; `hyphenation` exists but changes the numbers) |
| NLI / embeddings / slop spans (ML tier) | `ort` (ONNX Runtime) or `candle`; `gline-rs` for GLiNER; `tokenizers` |
| Perplexity / attention (generative tier) | `llama-cpp-2` (llama.cpp bindings, GGUF models) |
| Date canonicalization (grounding) | plain code or `chrono` |

### 11.1 Family A — AI-slop tells

**`overused-word`** · warn/advisory · density + co-occurrence gated
Weighted word list; weights are measured LLM over-use ratios (Kobak 2025 / Liang 2024). Full map (word: weight; inflections share the base weight):

- Tier 1 (measured): `delve/delves/delving/delved` 28 · `meticulous/meticulously` 34.7 · `intricate/intricately` 11.2 · `commendable/commendably` 9.8 · `underscore/underscores/underscoring/underscored` 13.8 · `showcase/showcases/showcasing/showcased` 10.7
- Tier 2 (strong, unquantified, weight 4): `realm` · `pivotal` · `garner/garners/garnered` · `boasts/boast` · `adept` · `groundbreaking`
- Heuristic (low confidence): `tapestry` 1.5 · `testament` 1.5 · `leverage/leveraging` 1.5 · `robust` 1.5 · `seamless/seamlessly` 1.5 · `nuanced` 1.5 · `multifaceted` 1.5 · `potential` 1.2 · `elevate/elevates/elevating` 1.2 (active forms only — "elevated privileges" is legitimate)

Mechanics: collect all hits; `density = hits/words×1000`; `score = Σweights/words×1000`. **Gate:** ≥2 distinct slop words, OR (≥2 hits AND density ≥ 4/1k). **Severity:** warn when ≥3 distinct words or score ≥ 20, else advisory; never error.

**`marketing-buzzword`** · warn · fires per hit
Full list: `streamline, streamlines, streamlining, empower, empowers, empowering, supercharge, supercharges, world-class, enterprise-grade, cutting-edge, game-changing, game changer, game-changer, next-generation, next-gen, best-in-class, turnkey, mission-critical, synergy, synergies, holistic, paradigm shift, frictionless, bleeding-edge, unparalleled, unrivaled, state-of-the-art, unlock the full potential, unlocks the full potential, unlock the power, harness the power, harnessing the power`.

**`cliche-opener`** · warn · sentence-start only
Pattern (must pass `isSentenceStart`): `In today's (fast-paced|modern|digital) (world|age)` · `In the (ever-evolving|ever-changing|rapidly changing) (landscape|world) of` · `In the realm of` · `In the digital age` · `In an (era|age) of` · `When it comes to` · `At its core` · `In the world of`.

**`filler-phrase`** · warn
`It's important to note that` · `It is important to note` · `It's worth noting` · `It is worth noting` · `worth mentioning that` · `Needless to say` · `At the end of the day` · `That being said` · `It should be noted that` (apostrophes optional in the `It's` forms).

**`manufactured-contrast`** · warn · "the strongest AI cadence tell"
Two patterns, both confined to one sentence (no `.!?\n` inside the gap): `\bnot\s+(just|only|merely|simply)\b … \b(it's|but|rather|they're|we're)\b` and `\bnot only\b … \bbut( also)?\b`.

**`conclusion-restate`** · warn · line-start (blockquote `>` allowed)
Line-initial markers: `In conclusion` · `In summary` · `To sum up` · `In essence` · `Overall` · `Ultimately` · `All in all`.

**`vague-attribution`** · warn · suppressed near citations
Phrases: `studies show` · `research suggests` · `research shows` · `experts say|argue|believe` · `many believe` · `it is widely regarded|believed|known` · `industry reports` · `some say` · `critics argue`. Suppression: skip if the following 200 chars contain a markdown link `](`, `http(s)://`, a bracketed footnote `[1]`, or a caret footnote `^1`.

**`despite-challenges-closer`** · warn
One-sentence pattern: `despite (its|these|the|ongoing|numerous) … (challenges|difficulties|obstacles|setbacks) … (continues to|remains|still) (thrive|evolve|grow|serve|play|stand|endure)`.

**`significance-boilerplate`** · warn
`stands as a testament` · `marking a pivotal moment` · `leaving an indelible mark` · `enduring legacy` · `key turning point` · `plays a (vital|crucial|pivotal|key|significant) role` · `rich (history|tapestry|tradition)` · `navigat(e|ing) the (complexities|complex landscape) of`.

**`em-dash-overuse`** · warn · whole-doc density
Count `—` plus space-surrounded `--` (lookbehind/lookahead on whitespace). Gate: ≥3 dashes AND >4 per 1k words (human baseline ~3/1k); one finding at the first dash reporting count + rate. Zero tolerance: every dash flagged individually ("end the sentence, or use a comma or parentheses").

**`semicolon-overuse`** · advisory · whole-doc density
Count `;` excluding HTML entities (lookbehinds for `&name`, `&#nnn`, `&#xhh`) and table lines. Gate: ≥3 AND >5/1k; one finding at the first. Zero tolerance: each semicolon flagged at warn.

**`emoji-decoration`** · warn
Line-initial emoji, optionally after a bullet marker: `^\s*([-*+]\s*)?<emoji>` where emoji covers `☀-➿`, `⬀-⯿`, variation selector, and `U+1F000–U+1FAFF`.

**`bold-lead-in-list`** · warn
Over `ctx.listItems`: an item is *shaped* if its text matches `^\s*\*\*[^*]+\*\*\s*[:—-]`. Count maximal runs of shaped items on **consecutive lines**; a run of ≥3 emits one finding at the run head ("the AI listicle template").

**`assistant-meta`** · **error**

`Great question` · `You're absolutely right` · `That's a great point` · `Excellent question` · `What a fascinating`.

**`smart-quotes`** · advisory
Count `‘ ’ “ ”`; fire once at the first when ≥3 (or any, under zero tolerance).

**`unicode-artifact`** · warn · per char
Invisible characters: no-break space U+00A0, narrow no-break/thin space, zero-width space U+200B, zero-width non-joiner U+200C, zero-width joiner U+200D, BOM/zero-width no-break space U+FEFF. Message includes the codepoint.

**`hedge-overuse`** · warn/advisory · density-gated
Full list: `it could be argued, arguably, to some extent, in many ways, in some ways, more often than not, generally speaking, broadly speaking, in a sense, for all intents and purposes, tends to, somewhat, sort of, kind of`. Gate: ≥2 hits AND (≥3 hits OR ≥3/1k). Severity: warn when ≥4 hits, else advisory; every hit is emitted once the gate opens.

**`negative-parallelism`** · advisory · ≥2 across four patterns
`,\s+not\s+<2–30 chars>[.!?]` · `Not \w+. Not \w+` · `\w+ rather than \w+` · line-initial `Rather,\s`.

**`tricolon-overuse`** · advisory · ≥3
`\w+, \w+, and \w+`. The bar is ≥3 because the *reflex* is the tell — and a lower bar would fight `serial-comma`, which wants the Oxford comma this rule would then flag.

**`serves-as-copula`** · advisory · ≥2
`serves as, serve as, stands as, stand as, acts as, functions as, represents a, exemplifies, embodies` — ""is" often reads cleaner".

**`media-coverage-boilerplate`** · advisory · per hit
`featured in, profiled in, has been featured, and other prominent outlets, maintains a strong, a strong social media presence, an active digital presence, garnered attention`.

**`future-outlook-speculation`** · advisory · per hit
`the future of, evolving landscape, continues to evolve, is poised to, on the horizon, in the years to come, only time will tell, the road ahead`.

**`conversational-scaffolding`** · advisory · per hit
`let's delve into, let's break this down, let's dive in, let's explore, let's unpack, deep dive into, take a deep dive, think of it as, think of it like, imagine a world where, to put it simply, here's the kicker, here's the thing, buckle up, spoiler alert, plot twist`.

**`superficial-ing-participle`** · advisory · ≥2
Comma followed by a vague-significance participle: `, (highlighting|underscoring|emphasizing|reflecting|symbolizing|showcasing|fostering|ensuring|contributing to|paving the way)`. The finding anchors at the participle, not the comma (the separator may be comma+newline).

**`transition-scaffolding`** · advisory · ≥2
Line/paragraph-initial `Additionally|Moreover|Furthermore|However|Consequently|Nevertheless`.

**`interrogative-answer`** · advisory
Rhetorical-fragment cadence: `(^|[.!?]\s)((The|Its|Their|His|Her|Our)\s+\w+)\?\s+[A-Z]\w+\.` — "The answer? Simple."

**`excessive-bold`** · advisory · whole-doc
Fire once when bold spans ≥4 AND rate ≥3 per 100 words.

**`listicle-reflex`** · advisory · whole-doc
Fire once when list items ≥5 AND ≥50% of them are ≤4 words.

**`uniform-cadence`** · advisory · whole-doc aggregate (zero-tolerance no-op)
Per-sentence word counts (zeros dropped). Requires ≥6 sentences and mean ≥4 words. Coefficient of variation `CV = stddev/mean`; flag when `CV < 0.25`. Human engaging prose sits at CV ≈ 0.5–0.8+; this is the model-free burstiness check.

**`emphasis-as-heading`** · advisory
A whole line that is only a short bold phrase used as a fake header: `^[ \t]*(\*\*|__)(1–48 chars, not ending in [.:!?,;] or whitespace)\1[ \t]*$`, skipping table lines. A trailing colon means a label ("**Fields:**") and a period means emphasis — neither is a heading. Distinct from `bold-lead-in-list` (a run of list items).

**`hype-intensifier`** · advisory · per hit
`greatly, vastly, hugely, immensely, enormously, tremendously, remarkably, crucial, crucially, pivotal, paramount, invaluable, one of the most, a great deal of`.

### 11.2 Family B — Clarity & concision

**`passive-voice`** · advisory (warn with by-agent)
Pattern: auxiliary `am|is|are|was|were|be|been|being` + up to two `-ly` adverbs + a participle — either a regular `-ed`/`-en` form or one of the irregular participles:
`arisen awoken beaten begun broken brought built chosen done drawn driven eaten fallen forgotten frozen given gone grown hidden known made paid seen sold sent shown taken thrown told thought woven written found held kept led lost meant met put read run set`.
Exclusions, in order: (1) masked-adjacency check (§11.0.2); (2) the pseudo-participle stoplist (words ending -ed/-en that are not participles):
`even often seven open aspen been keen teen green screen then when hen pen ten amen omen alien barren brazen dozen garden golden heaven eleven hyphen kitchen linen listen oxygen siren sudden wooden woolen children happen chicken token red bed shed wed hundred indeed sacred naked wicked wretched crooked rugged ragged jagged hatred kindred`;
(3) predicate-adjective participles — skipped unless followed by `by`:
`interested located excited based related done born involved supposed used pleased concerned tired limited known given dedicated committed advanced detailed`;
(4) a following preposition `in|about|with|at|of|to|for` (unless `by`). A following ` by ` upgrades severity to warn.

All `\w{3,}ly` tokens minus the non-adverb stoplist:
`only family reply apply supply july italy ally rely multiply early ugly holy likely lonely friendly daily weekly monthly yearly silly jelly belly fully`.
Gate: ≥5 hits AND ≥25/1k → one finding at the first hit. Zero tolerance: every `-ly` adverb flagged individually.

**`undefined-acronym`** · advisory · first occurrence per acronym
Token `[A-Z]{3,5}` (optional plural `s`), skipping: the allowlist below; a token followed by `.` (filename like `STYLE.md`); an acronym defined anywhere in the doc via parentheses (`ACR)` or `(ACR)`). Allowlist (full):

**`reading-grade`** · advisory · pack `plain` · whole-doc aggregate
Requires ≥30 words. Grade = mean of Flesch-Kincaid grade level and Coleman-Liau index (§11.12); flag when grade > 8 (or the PRODUCT.md target).

The Vale Microsoft adverb list, matched whole-word; every hit emitted once ≥2 present ("Remove it if it's not important to the meaning"). Full list:

### 11.3 Family C — shared style rules (always on)

**`sentence-case-heading`** · advisory
For each heading, take the text before the first `:` or `—`; extract words; skip if <3 words. Count capitalized words (`[A-Z][a-z]…`) excluding the first word, all-caps acronyms, and the small-word set `a an the and or but for nor of to in on at by as is are with from into via per vs`. Flag when ≥2 are capped; the message shows the sentence-cased rewrite (first word and acronyms preserved).

**`heading-end-punctuation`** · warn — heading text ends with `.`, `:`, or `!`.

**`word-swap`** · advisory · map rule, full map:
`leverage→use · e.g.→for example · i.e.→that is · etc→and so on · execute→run · grayed out→unavailable · and/or→or · deselect→clear · login→sign in (verb) · log in→sign in · e-mail→email · check box→checkbox · drop-down→dropdown`.
(`abort` deliberately absent — `violent-tech-metaphor` covers it.) Pack precedence: under Microsoft, `e.g.`/`i.e.` are suppressed here (`ms-foreign-abbrev` owns them); under Google, `e.g.`/`i.e.`/`etc` (`latinism-abbreviation` owns them).

**`serial-comma`** · advisory
`\w+, \w+ (and|or) \w+` missing the Oxford comma. Skips sentence-initial matches (introductory adverbial, "Yesterday, John and Mary arrived" — not a list). Self-suppresses entirely under the AP pack (`ap-serial-comma` flags the opposite).

**`intro-comma`** · advisory
Two high-precision cases at sentence start (leading `>*_#-` markers stripped):
1. Conjunctive-adverb opener with no comma: `moreover furthermore nevertheless nonetheless consequently meanwhile additionally therefore conversely accordingly` followed directly by a word. (`However`, `Similarly`, `Subsequently` are deliberately excluded — "However you slice it", "Similarly designed systems" are premodifiers, not openers.)
2. Leading subordinate clause with no internal break: opener in `because although though if unless whereas whenever wherever while when once after before until since even though even if as long as as soon as`, sentence has no `,;:—` anywhere, ≥8 words, and the next word is **not** a tech noun (`loops?|statements?|blocks?|clauses?|conditions?|expressions?|keywords?|functions?|methods?|classes|hooks?|branches|cases?|comprehensions?` — "While loops are…" is a noun phrase). Introductory participial/infinitive phrases are deliberately out of scope (needs a parser to separate "To ship, we tested" from "To ship on time is hard").

**`use-contractions`** · advisory
The negation subset of the contraction map (keys containing `not`/`cannot`): `do not→don't · does not→doesn't · did not→didn't · is not→isn't · are not→aren't · was not→wasn't · were not→weren't · cannot→can't · can not→can't · will not→won't · would not→wouldn't · should not→shouldn't · could not→couldn't · have not→haven't · has not→hasn't`.

**`second-person`** · advisory — `(the user|users) (should|can|must|may|need to|needs to|will|might|have|has|access|get)` → "you …".

**`present-tense`** · advisory — `you will <verb>` → "you <verb>".

**`singular-they`** · warn · map rule:
`he or she→they · she or he→they · his or her→their · her or his→their · him or her→them · he/she→they · (s)he→they · s/he→they · his/her→their`.

**`no-please-instructions`** · advisory — any `please`.

**`terminology-consistency`** · advisory
Variant groups; flag (once per group, at the second variant found) when ≥2 distinct variants of one concept appear, located with a word-boundary regex (plain `indexOf` can land inside "screenlogin"). Built-in groups:
`[sign in | log in | login] · [email | e-mail] · [dropdown | drop-down] · [website | web site] · [checkbox | check box] · [filename | file name] · [setup | set-up] · [username | user name]` — **plus every STYLE.md glossary Use/Not row** (§10.2).

**`acronym-case`** · advisory
If a known acronym (the §11.2 allowlist) appears UPPERCASE in the doc, flag lowercase occurrences of the same token (`ddl` when `DDL` is present), once per token. Stoplist of allowlist entries that are also English words/SQL keywords/callout labels (never flagged):
`note tip info warning important caution danger attention hint example see warn error debug trace idea and or not null true false get put post head new all desc asc ok us jar war zip tar bin pr ram`.

**`acronym-plural`** · advisory — `([A-Z]{2,5})'s` → "use `…s` for the plural; keep `'s` only for the possessive".

**`inconsistent-capitalization`** · advisory
Multi-word Title-Case phrases (`[A-Z][a-z]+( [A-Z][a-z]+)+`) that also appear fully lowercase elsewhere. Leading sentence-initial stopwords are shed first (full stoplist: `the a an this that these those it he she they we you i if when while for and but or not as at by in on to of is are was were be note tip see use run add get set so such each any all`); requires ≥2 remaining words (single capitalized words carry a real proper-vs-generic distinction and are too noisy); skips headings and table lines; one finding per phrase.

**`fenced-code-language`** · advisory — an *opening* fence line ```` ``` ```` with no language token (fences alternate open/close; only openers flag). Runs on raw text (fences are masked).

**`duplicate-heading`** · advisory — same heading text (case-insensitive) used more than once; flags the repeats.

**`markup-leak`** · advisory — `^#{1,6}` immediately followed by a non-space non-`#` char ("#Heading").

**`thematic-break-before-heading`** · advisory — a `---`/`***`/`___` break whose next non-blank line is a heading ("an AI scaffold; remove it").

**`bullet-overuse`** · advisory · whole-doc — fire once when list items ≥8 AND ≥50% of non-blank lines are list items.

**`double-space`** · advisory — two spaces between word characters (`([^\s.!?:;])(  )(\S)` — sentence-spacing after punctuation is allowed), skipping table lines.

**`redundant-acronym`** · warn · per hit, full list:
`ATM machine, PIN number, LCD display, HIV virus, RAM memory, PDF format, ISBN number, GPS system, CPU unit, UPC code, NIC card, please RSVP, HTTP protocol, IP protocol, SIN number, VIN number`.

**`indefinite-article`** · advisory
`(a|an) <word>` with sound-based exception lists. Skips: matches adjacent to `&`/`.` (abbreviations like D&A); masked-adjacency check (§11.0.2). Exception lists — words needing `an` despite a consonant letter: `hour, honest, honor, heir, honour`; words needing `a` despite a vowel letter: `university, unicorn, unique, unit, user, used, useful, european, one, once, ubiquitous, url, ui, utility, eulogy`. Four branches: `a`+vowel-sound → "an"; `an`+consonant-sound → "a"; `an`+vowel-letter-but-consonant-sound → "a"; `a`+consonant-letter-but-vowel-sound → "an".

**`placeholder-citation`** · warn — `[citation needed]` · `(Author, Year)` · `(Year)` · `[REF]` · `[TODO]` · `[TK]` · `[??]`.

**`tracking-param-in-citation`** · warn — a URL containing `?`/`&` + `utm_*`, `fbclid`, or `gclid`.

**`malformed-doi-isbn`** · advisory — `doi:<value>` not matching `10.NNNN/suffix`; `ISBN` whose digit count (after stripping separators, `X` allowed) is neither 10 nor 13.

**`unused-named-ref`** · advisory — a reference definition `[id]: url` never used by `][id]` or shortcut `[id]`.

### 11.4 Family C — Microsoft pack

Native rules:

- **`no-space-em-dash`** · advisory — spaced em-dashes ` — `; one finding per doc reporting the count (spaced em-dashes are a legitimate style; the convention is flagged once, not per use).

- **`microsoft-ampm`** · advisory — `12AM`, `12 am`, `12 a.m.` forms → "Use 'AM' or 'PM' (preceded by a space)". Table lines skipped.

Full list: `a victim of, able-bodied, an epileptic, birth defect, crippled, differently abled, disabled, dumb, handicapped, handicaps, healthy person, hearing-impaired, lame, maimed, mentally handicapped, missing a limb, mute, non-verbal, normal person, sight-impaired, slow learner, stricken with, suffers from, vision-impaired`.

- **`ms-foreign-abbrev`** · advisory — `e.g.→for example · i.e.→that is · viz.→namely · ergo→therefore · eg/ie` (bare `eg`/`ie`/`ergo` must be lowercase so "IE" the browser doesn't flag; dotted forms match either case; must be followed by space/comma).
- **`ms-gender-slash`** · warn (family D) — `he/she`, `s/he`.
- **`ms-gender-bias`** · warn (family D) — full pair list (pattern → replacement; `m[ae]n` covers man/men):

  `family early only supply apply reply assembly friendly daily weekly monthly yearly hourly ally holy ugly lovely lonely lively costly deadly silly jelly belly italy curly burly surly wobbly bubbly gnarly melancholy anomaly monopoly panoply wholly homely timely orderly elderly likely unlikely`.

- **`ap-serial-comma`** · advisory — flags the Oxford comma's *presence* (`\w+, \w+, (and|or) \w+`, anchored at the comma before the conjunction). The shared `serial-comma` self-suppresses under AP, so the two never both fire.

- **`chicago-number-style`** · advisory — spell out whole numbers ≤100 in prose (1–3-digit standalone numerals, value ≤ 100, tables skipped). Chicago also requires the Oxford comma — that's the always-on shared `serial-comma`.
- **`chicago-directional-s`** · advisory · map — `towards→toward · afterwards→afterward · backwards→backward · upwards→upward · downwards→downward · onwards→onward`.
- **`chicago-percent-symbol`** · advisory — digit + `%` → spell out "percent" in running prose.
- **`chicago-em-dash-spacing`** · advisory — spaced em dash ` — ` → close it up.
- **`chicago-ellipsis`** · advisory — the `…` glyph → three spaced periods ". . .".
- **`chicago-united-states-noun`** · advisory — `the U.S.`/`the US` used as a noun (followed by a verb `is/are/was/were/has/have/had/will/would` or terminal punctuation) → spell out "United States"; abbreviate only as an adjective.
- **`chicago-ibid`** · advisory — `ibid.`, `op. cit.`, `loc. cit.` → shortened citations (Chicago 17th ed.).

### 11.8 Family C — Plain pack

- **`plain-long-sentence`** · advisory — sentences of 21–30 words (the band the shared 30-word `long-sentence` misses, so the two never double-report). PLAIN wants <20.
- **`plain-hidden-verb`** · advisory · map, full:
  `make a determination→determine · provide an explanation→explain · conduct a review→review · perform a calculation→calculate · give authorization→authorize · make a recommendation→recommend · reach a decision→decide · make use of→use · make reference to→refer to · provide notification→notify · make an adjustment→adjust · is in violation of→violates`.
- **`plain-shall`** · advisory — every `shall` ("ambiguous in instructions — use 'must'").
- **`plain-required-to`** · advisory · map — `is required to→must · are required to→must · will be required to→must`.
- **`plain-legalese-phrase`** · advisory · map — `pursuant to→under · in accordance with→under · prior to→before`.
- **`plain-legalese-word`** · advisory — `herein, thereof, aforementioned, heretofore, notwithstanding, hereinafter`.
- **`plain-double-negative`** · advisory — `not (uncommon|unusual|unlikely|unreasonable|unimportant|insignificant|infrequent|inexpensive|unhelpful|impractical|unclear)` → state it positively.
- **`reading-grade`** — §11.2.

### 11.9 Family D — inclusive & accessible (always on)

**`gendered-language`** · warn · map, full:
`chairman→chair · chairmen→chairs · mankind→humanity · manpower→workforce · man-hours→person-hours · manned→staffed · salesman→salesperson · salesmen→salespeople · policeman→police officer · policemen→police officers · layman→layperson · laymen→laypeople · freshman→first-year student · fireman→firefighter · firemen→firefighters · stewardess→flight attendant · mailman→mail carrier · businessman→businessperson · man-made→artificial`.
Pack precedence: under Microsoft/Google, the terms their gender-bias pack rules also match are suppressed here (`mankind, manpower, salesman, salesmen, policeman, policemen, fireman, firemen, stewardess, mailman, freshman`) so one token never reports twice.

**`ableist-language`** · warn + advisory · two maps:
warn (metaphorical): `crazy→wild / baffling · insane→extreme · psycho→erratic · lame→weak · dumb→foolish · tone-deaf→insensitive · cripple/cripples/crippling→degrade(s)/degrading`. advisory (CS-idiomatic): `sanity check→consistency check · sane→reasonable · dummy value→placeholder value`.

**`vague-link-text`** · warn (WCAG) — link text (trimmed, lowercased) exactly one of: `click here, here, read more, this, this link, link, more`.

**`skipped-heading`** · warn / advisory — a heading more than one level below its predecessor (h2→h4); advisory for a second h1.

**`person-first-language`** · warn · map, full:
`suffers from→has · suffering from→living with · victim of→person affected by · wheelchair-bound→wheelchair user · confined to a wheelchair→uses a wheelchair · an epileptic→a person with epilepsy · the disabled→disabled people · the mentally ill→people with mental illness · normal people→people without disabilities`.

**`gendered-address`** · advisory — `guys, gentlemen, ladies` → "everyone / folks".

**`tech-historical-terms`** · warn + advisory
warn map (full): `blacklist(s)→blocklist(s) · blacklisted→blocked · whitelist(s)→allowlist(s) · whitelisted→allowed · master/slave→primary/replica · grandfathered/grandfather→legacy · blackhat→unethical · whitehat→ethical · first-class citizen→fully supported · sanity→confidence`.
advisory map (high-FP, context-dependent): `master→primary / main · slave→replica / worker · native→built-in · primitive→basic · tribe→team` — suppressed when the ±12-char context matches the exemption regex `master's|scrum master|master class|native speaker|primitive type|native to`.

**`violent-tech-metaphor`** · advisory · map, full:
`abort(s)→stop(s) · kill→end · killing→ending · hang(s)→stop(s) responding · blast radius→scope of impact · dmz→perimeter network`. Suppressed when followed by a number (`kill -9`). `hit` deliberately excluded — "cache hit", "hit the endpoint" are standard.

**`ageist-classist-cultural`** · advisory · map, full:
`ghetto→makeshift · gypsy→traveler · gypped→cheated · oriental→Asian · eskimo→Inuit · third-world/third world→developing · the elderly→older adults · illegal immigrant/illegal alien→undocumented immigrant · sketchy→questionable`.

**`missing-alt-text`** · warn — an image with empty alt text (explicit empty alt for decorative images is the documented escape).

**`all-caps-shouting`** · advisory — a run of ≥3 all-caps words of ≥2 letters ("screen readers spell it out").

**`bare-url`** · advisory — a raw `http(s)://` URL in prose (not a link target `](…)`, autolink `<…>`, attribute/quoted context, or reference definition `[id]: url`) → use descriptive link text.

### 11.10 Grounding rules (factcheck engine)

Emitted with family `grounding`. Rule ids: **`number-date-mismatch`** (error) · **`contradicts-fact`** (error) · **`unsupported-claim`** (warn under `--source`, else advisory) · **`ungrounded-span`** (advisory, attention tier).

**Typed-span extraction** (per sentence and per fact; later extractors skip offset ranges already covered):
1. **percent** — `(\d+(.\d+)?) ?%` → float.
2. **money** — `$ N[,N…][.N] (million|billion|thousand|k|m|b)?` → value scaled (k/thousand ×10³, m/million ×10⁶, b/billion ×10⁹).
3. **date** — three forms, all canonicalized to ISO (`YYYY-MM-DD`, or `YYYY-MM` for month-year): `YYYY-MM-DD`; `DD(st|nd|rd|th)? Month[,] YYYY`; `Month DD[,] YYYY` / `Month YYYY`. Two dates are *compatible* when equal or one is a coarser truncation of the other (`2024-03` vs `2024-03-15` — granularity, not contradiction).
4. **year** — standalone `(19|20)\d\d`.
5. **count** — any remaining `\d[\d,]*(.\d+)?` (commas stripped).

**Entities:** capitalized word sequences (connectors `of|the|and` allowed inside); a lone sentence-initial capitalized word is skipped unless it's an acronym or carries a digit; plus all-caps acronyms `[A-Z]{2,6}`. **Content tokens:** lowercase words ≥3 chars minus a ~90-word stopword list (articles, auxiliaries, prepositions, pronouns, question words).

**Fact parsing:** each non-heading, non-comment line of FACTS.md, list markers stripped; a trailing `(…)`/`[…]` containing a URL, `source:`, or a year is captured as the fact's source. With `--source <file>`, every sentence of the file is a fact.

**Retrieval:** for each claim, score every fact `shared content tokens + 2 × shared entities`; best fact is *relevant* when score ≥ 3 AND ≥1 shared token.

**Tier 0 verdicts:** a sentence is checkable when it has ≥1 typed span AND (≥2 content tokens OR ≥1 entity). If a relevant fact exists and shares a span *kind* with disjoint value sets → **error** (`number-date-mismatch` for date/year kinds, else `contradicts-fact`), citing both raw values and the fact line. If no relevant fact → `unsupported-claim` anchored at the highest-value span (money/percent/year/date preferred over count).

**NLI tier** (with `--models`; premise = fact, hypothesis = claim): typed-span mismatch stays the hard error; otherwise contradiction ≥ 0.60 and > entailment → `contradicts-fact` (error, with NLI %); entailment ≥ 0.55 → supported (no finding); else neutral → `unsupported-claim`. *Rust:* run the NLI cross-encoder via `ort` or `candle` + `tokenizers`.

**Decomposed tier** (`--decompose`/`--claims`): claim candidates are sentences ≥12 chars with (≥1 typed span OR ≥4 content tokens) — `--emit-claim-targets` prints exactly this list, and supplied claims align to it by index. Each atomic claim runs the same retrieve → typed-span → NLI pipeline; findings anchor to the *parent* sentence and carry the atomic claim in the message; identical sibling findings dedupe on `(ruleId, offset, message)`. Decomposition is done by the agent, never by the CLI.

**Attention tier** (`--deep`/`--ground=attention`): sentences ≥12 chars are scored for attention lookback against the source; a span below threshold (default **0.10**) emits `ungrounded-span` — "reads as ungrounded", never an assertion of falsehood. *Rust:* `llama-cpp-2` with a small GGUF model, eager attention capture (§17).

### 11.11 Grammar rules (opt-in)

The grammar pass is **Harper** (Automattic) — natively a Rust library (`harper-core`; the prototype used its WASM build `harper.js`). Fully offline, no network. Behavior contract:

- Opt-in only (`--grammar` / `detector.grammar` / `hook.grammar`); the default detector stays pure-deterministic and synchronous.
- Run Harper's markdown parser (skips fenced/inline code; offsets return in the original source).
- **Keep only high-precision lint kinds:** `Agreement` (subject-verb/article-noun), `Grammar` (structural — "allows to deliver"), `Miscellaneous` (includes wrong indefinite article), `Eggcorn` ("for all intensive purposes"), `Malapropism`, `Nonstandard`, `BoundaryError` (run-ons), `Redundancy` ("and also").
- **Dropped kinds** (heavy false positives on technical markdown, or overlap with Mari's own rules): Spelling, Typo, Capitalization, Formatting, Punctuation, WordChoice, Style, Regionalism, Readability.
- **Disabled individual rules** within kept kinds: `MassNouns` (mislabels ordinary count nouns), `MissingPreposition` (fires vaguely on bare nouns).
- Findings emit as `grammar-<kind lowercased>`, family `grammar`, severity warn, with Harper's message plus its **top 3 suggestions** (an empty replacement renders as "(remove)"), sorted by offset, capped at **30 per file**.
- Grammar must never break detection: any failure (missing dependency, engine error) returns zero findings, with at most one stderr notice.
- (Rust-specific simplification: Harper's scalar-index vs UTF-16 offset conversion in the JS prototype is unnecessary — `harper-core` and Rust strings share UTF-8 byte offsets.)

### 11.12 Readability internals

Used by `reading-grade` (and the `--score` word stats). Syllable counting is heuristic (~3–8% per-word error; fine for aggregate scoring):

1. Lowercase, strip non-letters. Exceptions table first: `every 2 · business 2 · different 3 · comfortable 3 · vegetable 3 · february 4 · area 3 · idea 3 · science 2 · being 2 · create 2 · people 2 · simile 3 · queue 1 · the 1 · average 3 · naive 2 · real 1 · cereal 3`.
2. Strip silent endings (`-es` after non-l vowel-consonant, `-ed`, silent `-e`); strip leading `y`.
3. Count vowel groups `[aeiouy]{1,2}`.
4. +1 for consonant+`le` endings; +1 for hiatus (`ia|io|ua|eo`). Minimum 1.

Grade formulas (W words, S sentences, syl syllables, L letters):
`FKGL = 0.39·(W/S) + 11.8·(syl/W) − 15.59` · `CLI = 0.0588·(L/W·100) − 0.296·(S/W·100) − 15.8` · reported grade = `(FKGL + CLI) / 2`.

### 11.13 Fixture discipline

Every rule ships a bad→good fixture pair; the test suite asserts each rule fires on its bad fixture and stays silent on its good one (~180 assertions). Regression checks cover table-aware number rules, masking (front matter, comments, shortcodes), CJK/generated/vendored skipping, and large-repo false-positive budgets. A deliberate-slop self-test fixture must produce a known finding set.

---

## 12. Slop score

`mari detect --score` computes a 0–100 score (higher = sloppier). Exact mechanics — the breakdown is always returned so the number is explainable (Mari never asserts "this is AI-written"; it shows why a passage reads machine-made):

1. **Weighted finding mass:** each finding contributes `SEV × FAM` where `SEV` = error 3 / warn 2 / advisory 1, and `FAM` = ai-slop 1.0 / grounding 1.0 / inclusive 0.5 / clarity 0.4 / style 0.3 (unknown family 0.3). `per1k = Σ / words × 1000`.
2. **Saturating base:** `base = 100 × (1 − e^(−per1k/35))` — heavy slop approaches 100 without exceeding it.
3. **Human-signal discount:** count contractions (`\w+['’](t|s|re|ve|ll|d|m)`) plus first-person tokens (`I, I'm, I've, I'll, I'd, we/We (+'re 've 'll 'd), my/My, our/Our, me/Me, us/Us` — case-sensitive only for bare `I`, so list markers and math `i` don't count). `discount = min(15, (contractions + firstPerson)/words × 1000 × 1.5)`.
4. **Deterministic score:** `max(0, base − discount)`.
5. **Model blend** (only when a machine-likelihood `m ∈ [0,1]` is available via `--models`): `score = 0.8 × deterministic + 0.2 × (m × 100)` — the model term never dominates.
6. Round and clamp to 0–100. **Bands:** `clean` < 12 · `light` 12–29 · `moderate` 30–59 · `heavy` ≥ 60.

The reported breakdown includes: word count, finding count, weighted density per 1k, findings by family, human signals (contraction count, first-person count, discount), and machine likelihood when present.

`mari narrative score` is the separate whole-document narrative metric (§5.4).

## 13. Editorial flows

### 13.1 Registers
Every editing task runs under a register (from task cues, target surface, or PRODUCT.md):

| Register | Bars |
|---|---|
| **docs** (default) | ~25-word sentence ceiling, second person, imperative mood. |
| **marketing** | ~30 words, specificity over superlatives. |
| **editorial** | Voice/POV allowed, rhythm variation expected. |
| **microcopy** | ~12 words, error formula (what happened / why / how to fix), never blame the user, i18n discipline (~30% expansion budget, variables out of grammar). |

### 13.2 Skill setup phase (before any editing verb)
1. Load editorial context (PRODUCT.md, STYLE.md, FACTS.md; if no PRODUCT.md → run `init style`).
2. Load the verb's reference flow.
3. Read a representative file for voice.
4. Resolve the register.
5. Run the detector on the target.
6. If the target is a recognized asset type, load its archetype.
Deterministic commands (`detect audit asset i18n platform check`) skip setup and run directly.

### 13.3 Narrative tier (`deslop --narrative`)
Seven whole-document dimensions, one pass each, in order: (1) stated morals, (2) tidy structure, (3) machine parallelism, (4) performed embodiment, (5) vague allusion, (6) no concession / no reader, (7) flat time. Scored via `mari narrative`. Register-gated: docs/microcopy apply only dimensions 1, 3, 5. Never fabricate mess; don't chase zero.

### 13.4 Universal guardrails
Detector findings are leads, not verdicts. Never claim text is AI-written. Preserve meaning and author voice. Keep human signals (sentence-initial And/But/So, deliberate fragments). Re-run the detector after editing; a verb that introduces new findings must fix them.

---

## 14. Asset archetypes

Each archetype defines canonical required sections, tone norms, and a 5-point review rubric:

| Type | Required sections | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| `runbook` | Overview, Prerequisites, Steps, Rollback, Escalation | incident-response "5 A's" |
| `adr` | Status, Context, Decision, Consequences | Nygard / MADR |
| `postmortem` | Summary, Impact, Timeline, Root Cause, Action Items, Lessons | Google SRE; blameless (`postmortem-blame` enforced) |
| `rfc` | Summary, Motivation, Alternatives, Drawbacks (+ rollout plan, open questions) | Rust RFC / Oxide RFD |
| `contributing` | standard contributor guide sections | community health |
| `code-of-conduct` | Contributor Covenant v2.1 | copied, attributed |
| `governance` | roles, decision process | CNCF / Apache patterns |
| `security` | reporting process, supported versions | GitHub SECURITY.md |

Teams can bring their own templates: a template dropped in `.mari/templates/<type>.md` overrides the built-in archetype for `scaffold` and `check`. When Claude drafts a document of a recognized type, the skill points it at the archetype (e.g. an RFC draft is checked for tradeoffs, alternatives, rollout plan, open questions).

---

## 15. Hooks

### 15.1 Post-edit hook
Registered per provider: Claude Code `PostToolUse` matcher `Edit|Write|MultiEdit` (timeout 10s); Cursor `afterFileEdit`; Codex `PostToolUse`; Copilot `postEdit`. Jobs, in order, per edited file:

1. **Prose lint** — run the detector on edited markdown (+ grammar if enabled). Output capped at `hook.maxFindings`; silent when clean and `hook.quiet`.
2. **i18n staleness** — if the edited file has translation siblings, note which localized files likely need updates.
3. **Edit-notify rules** — for any edited file matching a rule, emit its `notify` message (e.g. "API code changed — update docs/api/").
4. **Nudges** — for any edited file matching a nudge's `when` (and, if `when.symbol` is set, an edit intersecting that resolved span), emit a directive per nudge: `✎ nudge <name>: <when-target> changed — edit <target>[, <target>…]` plus its `message`. This tells the agent to make those edits now; the hook itself still never modifies files. A symbol that fails to resolve degrades to whole-file matching with a warning.
5. **Lineage impact** — if a confirmed lineage edge's endpoint drifted, emit a semantic-lineage notice (`⛓ …`) telling the agent which spans to reconcile. Suppressed for a span pair a nudge already fired on.
6. **Association notice** — derived-assoc "related files" note (suppressed when a nudge or lineage notice already fired).
7. **Knowledge pending-impact** — note when scanned knowledge affecting this file changed.
8. **Tag advisories** — editing a `stale`/`deprecated`-tagged file, or referencing `internal` content from a `customer-facing` file (§10.1).

Invariants: always exit 0; emit nothing on internal failure; respect `hook.*` toggles; never modify files.

### 15.2 Commit association (git hook, optional)
An opt-in `post-commit` hook associates new commits with relevant knowledge (issues, conversations, docs) via the edge graph and embedding neighbors. It also flags commits that touched code covered by an edit-notify rule or a nudge's `when` without a matching change to the notify target / nudge `edit` targets — "context is never lost."

---

## 16. Command router & skill routing

Mari's slash surface has two layers: a set of **standalone commands** for the high-frequency actions (so `/search why did we change pricing tiers` works without a `/mari` prefix), and the **`/mari` general router** that covers everything else — subcommand dispatch, natural-language questions, and intent phrases. Every standalone command is a thin skill wrapper over the same flow the router would run; behavior is identical whichever entry point is used.

### 16.1 Standalone commands (ship by default)

| Command | Flow | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `/search <question>` | Knowledge flow (§16.3) | Accepts natural language ("theres an outage in #incidents, what is causing it"), not just keyword queries. Flags pass through to `mari search`. |
| `/sync [source]` | `mari sync` | The one command **never** run unprompted; `/sync` is the explicit user prompt. |
| `/tag <path-or-ref> <status>` | `mari tag` | Also `/tag list`, `/tag remove`. |
| `/factcheck <file> [--source F]` | `mari factcheck` | Agent adds `--decompose` claim decomposition when depth is asked for. |
| `/audit [path]` | `mari audit` / `mari audit kb` | Bare path → detector report; "audit the knowledge base" phrasing → `audit kb`. |
| `/deslop <target>` | deslop verb (§13) | |
| `/tighten <target>` | tighten verb | |
| `/clarify <target>` | clarify verb | |
| `/sharpen <target>` | sharpen verb | |
| `/understate <target>` | understate verb | |
| `/critique <target>` | critique verb | Review only; never rewrites. |
| `/polish <target>` | polish verb | |
| `/draft <brief>` | draft verb | |

`<target>` may be a path, a natural-language reference ("the changelog", "the error copy"), or omitted — then the command applies to the file(s) just edited in the session, else asks.

**Pinning.** Teams can pin any other router-reachable action as a standalone command (e.g. `/docsite`, `/glossary`, `/outline`, `/soften`) or unpin defaults; the standalone set is a projection of the router, so pinning changes discovery, never behavior. Everything remains reachable as `/mari <verb|subcommand>` regardless of what is pinned.

### 16.2 The `/mari` general router

- **Bare `/mari <file>` or no-arg** → run detector, surface the top 2–3 recommended verbs; never auto-edit.
- **`/mari <known-subcommand> …`** → route to the command (init, sync, status, search, tag, config, features, docsite, glossary, facts, extract, nudge, rules, audit, localize, …). Any standalone command's verb also works here (`/mari deslop README.md` ≡ `/deslop README.md`).
- **Natural-language question** → knowledge flow (§16.3).
- **Editing intent phrases** map to verbs: "make it punchier"→sharpen, "cut it down"→tighten, "make it less salesy"→soften, "sounds like AI"→deslop, "prepare for launch"→polish, etc.
- **Coupling intent phrases** map to `nudge add`: "whenever X changes, update Y", "keep this section in sync with that function" → compose the `--when`/`--edit` pair (with `#symbol` when the user names a function or heading), confirm, and run it.
- **Connector setup** → the relevant `connect-<source>` skill: scope question (with per-source default), method choice, click-by-click credential walkthrough, the three credential-handling paths, `mari auth` + `mari track add` + first `mari sync`, confirmation.
- **Ambiguity rule:** when input could be either a question or an edit request, prefer the knowledge flow for interrogatives and the detector-first flow for file references; ask only when both readings are plausible and consequential.

### 16.3 Knowledge flow (shared by `/search` and `/mari <question>`)

Compose a toolbox, not one search — `search` with agent-generated `--variant`s, then `doc`/`thread`/`related`/`recent`/`neighbors`/`sql` as needed. Extract identifiers from early hits and feed them back as variants. **Never conclude from a truncated preview** — use `--full`. Answer from the current index even when stale; suggest `/sync` but never run it unprompted.

### 16.4 Guardrails

Setup is assistant-guided end-to-end; the user never has to run anything (but always may). Sync is the one command never run unprompted — `/sync` (or an explicit ask) is the only trigger. Standalone editorial commands follow the same verb contract as the router: preserve meaning and voice, rewrite-not-delete, re-run the detector after.

## 17. ML capability tiers

Detection and grounding are layered by model size, never "rules vs AI":

1. **Tier 0 — deterministic (always on):** the full rule registry, typed-span factcheck, structural checks. Instant, offline, dependency-free.
2. **Tier 1 — local small models (default-on once provisioned, `--no-models` to skip):** machine-likelihood (perplexity), NLI entailment/contradiction (factcheck + audit contradictions), zero-shot slop-span extraction (labels: marketing buzzword, hype phrase, vague corporate jargon, empty filler phrase, overused cliché), embeddings (search/explore/assoc). Models load lazily into a resident sidecar; only structured output crosses the boundary. *Rust:* `ort` (ONNX Runtime) or `candle` for the NLI cross-encoder and the required `qwen3-embedding-0.6b` embedding model, `tokenizers` for tokenization, `gline-rs` for GLiNER slop spans, and `fastembed` only when it runs that exact embedding model identity — all in-process, which removes the prototype's Python sidecar entirely.
3. **Tier 2 — local attention/generative (opt-in via configured model):** attention grounding with three modes — **coverage** (context the query ignores: dropped translation content, stale docs↔code), **grounding** (query sentences that ignore context: fabricated/unsupported), **focus** (where attention mass lands). Powers every `--deep` flag and `lineage refine`. ~seconds per document. *Rust:* `llama-cpp-2` (llama.cpp bindings) loads the GGUF model (qwen3.6 0.8b only), computes perplexity, and exposes attention capture for the mid-layer band — replacing the prototype's custom C++ binary.
4. **Agent tier:** anything requiring generation — query expansion, claim decomposition, rewriting, glossary harvest, narrative interpretation, and page drafting — is done by Claude in-session. Deterministic CLI surfaces may print candidate questions, spans, scores, and evidence, but they never call an LLM.

Capability env toggles (the only permitted env vars): model paths/ids for the sidecar and attention binary, device selection, and feature switches equivalent to `--models`/`--slop-spans`.

---

## 18. Output & UX conventions

- Human output colorized on TTY, grouped by family/source; plain otherwise.
- `--json` everywhere data is consumed by the agent.
- `--summary` for large trees (worst files + rule histogram).
- Previews: 5 lines × 110 chars; `--full [N]` for bodies.
- Staleness and auto-pull warnings go to **stderr** so they never corrupt JSON output.
- All destructive-ish operations (`scaffold`, `install`, `cloud init`) are idempotent and refuse to overwrite without `--force`.

---

## 19. Testing & quality bars (behavioral requirements)

- Per-rule bad→good fixture pairs (~180 assertions) — every rule must fire on bad and stay silent on good.
- Integration/regression suite (~35 checks) including masking, skip-lists, localized-file handling, table-aware rules.
- Model tests run real local inference (no stubs).
- Large-repo hardening: false-positive budget validated against big real documentation trees (hundreds of files).
- A deliberate-slop self-test fixture (`mari detect fixtures/sloppy.md` must find a known finding set).

---

## 20. Non-goals

- No SaaS requirement; no server in the core product (a hosted sync layer may exist later as an optional backend).
- No translation (i18n checks structure and coverage only).
- No source-code linting (prose in code strings is out of scope for v1; deliberately disabled in the prototype).
- No autofix by the detector; no editing external services' content.
- No PII redaction of indexed content in v1 (credentials protection only) — flagged as future work.
- No automatic sync, no background daemons, no cron in-core (users may wire their own cron/CI around `mari sync`).
- Legacy binary Office formats (`.doc`, `.ppt`) unsupported.

---

## 21. Glossary (of Mari itself)

- **Mari** (never "mari"/"MARI" in prose) — the product.
- **detector** (not "linter"/"scanner") — the deterministic rule engine.
- **finding** — one detector result (a lead, not a verdict).
- **register** — the writing context (docs/marketing/editorial/microcopy).
- **hook** — the post-edit integration.
- **AI tell / slop** — machine-flavored writing patterns.
- **source / connector** — an ingested knowledge system.
- **workspace** — per-repo personal state dir.
- **catalog** — the shared document/chunk index.
- **tag** — a curation status on a doc or file.
- **lineage edge** — a confirmed span↔span maintenance promise.
- **nudge** — a hand-declared edit obligation: when a file (or symbol span) changes, the agent is directed to edit named target files/spans.

---

## 22. Implementation decisions (v1 Rust build)

The v1 implementation is a single Rust crate (`mari`). Where the spec left an implementation choice open, v1 decides:

- **Storage:** the catalog and private state live in one DuckDB database per workspace (`catalog.duckdb`, bundled via the Rust `duckdb` crate — no external service). The `mari sql` surface queries it read-only. SQLite/rusqlite is not a v1 storage target. LanceDB remains the upgrade path if ANN at scale is needed.
- **Embedding:** `qwen3-embedding-0.6b` is the only permitted embedding model identity — no hash-vector fallback, no alternates. It produces 768-dimensional normalized text embeddings and uses task-aware encoding (retrieval queries are encoded as queries; document chunks are encoded as documents). v1 may run it through `candle` or `ort` + `tokenizers`, with `fastembed` acceptable only if it runs that exact model identity. Vectors are stored per workspace in **Lance format** (`vectors.lance`); similarity queries run in **DuckDB** over the Lance data through its Arrow integration. Sync embeds only chunks missing vectors (resumable, §6.0); `--rebuild` re-embeds everything. If the Qwen runtime is unavailable, embedding fails loudly and keyword-only search continues without writing `embeddings` rows.
- **Hybrid fusion:** query-time §7.3 weighted RRF is live — the keyword ranking fuses with the merged per-phrasing vector rankings (main query 1.0, each `--variant` 0.7), scaled by `search.vector_weight`/`keyword_weight` and §7.4 auto-routing; `search.hybrid=false` yields vector-only ranking. When vectors are unavailable the CLI warns loudly and returns keyword results.
- **Markdown parsing:** v1 implements the §11.0 engine contract directly — line-based masking (equal-length space blanking, newlines preserved) and regex structure extraction, exactly as the section specifies. `pulldown-cmark` remains the upgrade path if constructs outgrow the line model.
- **Rule evaluation:** rules live as Rust functions over a shared `Ctx`/`Emitter` contract, with the normative word/phrase lists as in-module consts. Every rule ships a bad→good fixture test in its module (§19 discipline; 170+ assertions).
- **Pattern matching:** large word/phrase maps use single case-insensitive `regex` alternations (which compile to Aho-Corasick internally — explicitly sanctioned by §11.0.5); `fancy-regex` carries the lookaround-heavy rules, with manual neighbor checks where lookbehinds would be variable-length.
- **Style-pack references:** Microsoft, Google, AP, Chicago, and plain-language packs are treated as source-backed data packs, with Vale-compatible rule mechanics where the spec names Vale parity. The implementation may study or port Vale pack data, but Mari's emitted rule IDs, severities, offsets, waivers, and JSON schema remain the product contract.
- **Grammar:** Harper is the grammar engine (`harper-core` 2.0 — 2.4/2.5 fail to compile on current rustc) — compiled in, opt-in at runtime per §11.11 (`--grammar` / `detector.grammar` / `hook.grammar`); kept-kinds filter, top-3 suggestions, 30-finding cap, engine failure yields zero findings.
- **Tier-2 attention** is in this build for localization: the attention engine (harvested from the mari-cli native extractor and ported to Rust over the `llama-cpp-sys-2` graph-callback FFI) captures `kq_soft_max` on the 0.60–0.88 layer band with flash attention disabled, averages layers+heads with the causal row shift and sink-column masking, and emits coverage/grounding findings against a small local GGUF (default `Qwen3.5-0.8B` Q4_K_M, auto-downloaded; `attention.model` overrides — the spec's "qwen3.6 0.8b" has no published 0.8B; 3.5 is the prototype's own preference). `mari i18n coverage`, `i18n conform --deep`, `factcheck --deep` (grounding — `ungrounded-span` advisories, default = `attention.threshold` (0.3): the §11.10 0.10 was calibrated for the prototype's row-normalized scores, and this port preserves absolute mass), `check --deep` (undocumented symbols + `doc-unanchored` passages against the public surface), and `explore --focus` (where attention mass concentrates in the top hits) all run it; findings are leads, not verdicts.
- **Machine-likelihood (§12 step 5) IS in this build:** `detect --score --models` computes the document's mean cross-entropy (log-perplexity) via the local attention model and blends it `0.8·deterministic + 0.2·(m·100)`; the breakdown reports `machineLikelihood`. It is an explainable signal, never an assertion that text is AI-written (§13.4).
- **The remaining ML tier 1** — NLI entailment/contradiction (factcheck `--models`) and zero-shot slop-span extraction (`--slop-spans`) — is not in this build. Runtime decision (recorded per docs/03): ONNX Runtime (`ort`) + `tokenizers` for the NLI cross-encoder, `gline-rs` for GLiNER slop spans, feature-gated behind `--features ml` so the default build stays lean; perplexity already reuses llama.cpp. Until then those two flags print a loud "not available in this build" note and degrade to the deterministic (and attention, for factcheck `--deep`) tiers without changing exit semantics.
- **Connectors:** all thirteen sources are implemented — `localfiles` and `git` locally, and Slack, Google Drive, GitHub, Confluence, Jira, Zendesk, Salesforce, HubSpot, Microsoft 365, Discord, and Linear over their HTTP APIs per §6, sharing one §6.0 contract implementation (retry/backoff honoring Retry-After, single 401 token-refresh, 60s timeout, per-source cursors in catalog state, content-hash re-embed authority, per-source prune rules). Live-service calls are exercised through unit tests over recorded payload shapes; a tracked-but-unconnected source remains a nudge, and one source's failure never aborts the others.
- **OCR (§8.6):** the DEFAULT PDF path is pure Rust/C — `ocr.backend = "text"` extracts embedded text natively via `pdf-extract`, no Python anywhere. The `baidu/Unlimited-OCR` model pipeline is the optional, config-selected backup for scanned content: `auto` extracts natively and sends only sparse pages (<16 extractable chars) through the Python toolchain; `ocr-model` sends every page. The toolchain auto-provisions into `~/.mari/ocr` on first use of a model tier (`ocr.auto_install`); within the model tiers there are no fallback engines, and any failure errors loudly for that file. PDFs flow through `localfiles`, Google Drive, and OneDrive sync; unchanged PDF bytes never re-extract. The model tiers additionally require an explicit `ocr.accept_remote_code=true` acknowledgement because Unlimited-OCR runs with `trust_remote_code=True` (executes code from the model repo); the default `text` backend never triggers this.
- **Office extraction (§8.5):** docx/docm, odt/fodt, rtf, pptx (per-slide headings + speaker notes), and xlsx (shared strings + computed values, per-sheet) extract natively via `zip` + `quick-xml`, flowing through `localfiles` and OneDrive sync; legacy binary `.doc`/`.ppt` stay unsupported (§20). HTML bodies flatten to markdown-lite per §8.5.
- **Cloud backends:** `git` backend is native (catalog copied under `.mari/catalog` + Git LFS `.gitattributes`); the `s3` backend shells out to the AWS CLI rather than embedding an AWS SDK.
- **Hook integration:** `mari hooks on` installs a Claude Code `PostToolUse` hook (`mari hook run`) into the repo's `.claude/settings.json`; the hook reads the harness JSON on stdin and honors all §15.1 invariants. The §15.2 commit-association hook is `mari hooks commit-on`, which installs a git `post-commit` hook running `mari hook commit` — it flags rule/nudge-covered commits missing their coupled edits and persists commit↔knowledge association edges.
- **Nudge symbol resolution** uses deterministic heuristics: markdown headings resolve to their section span; code symbols resolve via definition-line regexes (fn/class/const/def/export) with an indentation-bounded span — no tree-sitter dependency in v1.
- **`mari track <source> <add|remove|list> [ref] [--list-key <key>]`** is the concrete command behind "tracked refs", writing the source's list keys in committed `.mari/config.json`.
- **Humanizer vendoring** shells out to `git` for clone/update of `~/.mari/skills/humanizer`.
- **Plugin packaging (§16):** the repo doubles as the installable Claude Code plugin: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `skills/mari/SKILL.md` (with its reference flows and templates under `skills/mari/references/`), one `skills/connect-<source>/` per connector, the §16.1 default standalone commands under `commands/` (search, sync, tag, factcheck, audit, deslop, tighten, clarify, sharpen, understate, critique, polish, draft), and `hooks/hooks.json` registering the `PostToolUse` → `mari hook run` hook. Pinning/unpinning is adding or removing a command file.
- **Lineage curation:** `mari lineage <list|add|confirm|reject>` curates §8.3 edges by hand (`--by human` edges are confirmed on creation; `--by llm` proposals start `proposed`). Machine proposal *generation* remains Tier-2 (`lineage refine`) and is out of this build.
- **CI/CD:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs a macOS+Linux matrix of `cargo fmt --check`, build, `cargo clippy -D warnings`, the full test suite, the §19 deliberate-slop self-test, `mari check` (self-dogfood), a `cargo-deny` job (licenses/advisories/bans), and a model-cached real-inference job (embedding sync + semantic-search assertion). `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds prebuilt binaries for macOS (arm64/x86_64) and Linux (x86_64/arm64) with SHA-256 sidecars on a `v*` tag.
- **Portability:** GPU offload is configurable (`embedding.gpu_layers` / `attention.gpu_layers`, default 999 = offload all, clamped by llama.cpp with CPU fallback). Unix-only paths (venv `bin/` vs Windows `Scripts/`, 0600/0700 credential perms, the `sh` post-commit hook, PID liveness) are `#[cfg]`-guarded so the crate compiles on Windows; full Windows credential-ACL hardening and a Windows CI job are tracked in `docs/08`.
- **Model provisioning (§7 security):** both GGUFs download through a shared, resumable, checksum-verified provisioner into `~/.mari/models`. `mari model pull [embedding|attention|all]` and `mari model status` make it explicit; `embedding.model`/`attention.model` config paths override for air-gapped installs (`auto_download=false`). Checksums (`MODEL_SHA256`) are wired and enforced once the pinned revision's hash is recorded.
- **Concurrency & migrations (§8.6):** a per-workspace `sync.lock` (advisory PID file, stale locks reclaimed) makes a second concurrent `mari sync` exit cleanly. `ensure_schema` runs an idempotent, version-gated `migrate_schema` and stamps the embedding identity/dims only on creation; vector search hard-guards on an embedding-identity/dimension mismatch and refuses (pointing at `--rebuild`) rather than mixing incompatible vectors.
- **Cloud vector replication (§9):** the Lance `vectors.lance` dataset rides alongside the catalog — copied into `.mari/catalog` under Git LFS for the git backend, `aws s3 sync`-ed for S3 — so a consumer's search isn't silently keyword-only.
- **`mari doctor`** reports which optional external tools (git/gcloud/aws/python3) and models are present and which features they gate.
- **Humanizer:** the vendored-humanizer upstream is config-driven (`humanizer.repo`), defaulting to empty; `mari humanize ensure` errors cleanly asking for a URL rather than cloning a guessed repo.
- **Supply chain:** `deny.toml` enforces the license allowlist (MIT/Apache/BSD/ISC/…; copyleft and NonCommercial denied) and advisory checks; Office/XML/PDF extraction caps output size against hostile inputs (§7.5).
- **Community & docs:** the repo ships `LICENSE` (MIT), `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor Covenant v2.1), `SECURITY.md` (with the remote-code disclosure), and `CHANGELOG.md`; `mari check` passes on the repo. The remaining-work plan lives in `docs/`.
- **Editorial verbs** (`deslop`, `tighten`, …) remain agent-side skill flows per §17's agent tier; the CLI contributes `detect`/`audit`/`factcheck` and the reference flows shipped in this repo.
